description: Generate production-ready HTML, CSS, and Tailwind code for websites, landing pages, dashboards, and web applications. Use this skill when the user asks to "build a landing page", "create a website", "code a dashboard", "design with Tailwind", "write HTML", "create a web app", "build a SaaS page", "make a hero section", or requests any frontend code output. Also generates HTML-based social media graphics (Instagram, TikTok, YouTube thumbnails, OG images). Outputs working code with distinctive styling - NOT static images or PDFs. Uses a GENERATIVE design system - no templates, every design is unique.

# Generative Frontend Design System

Create distinctive, production-grade interfaces using **dimensional generation**, not template selection.

## The Core Philosophy

```
OLD WAY: Pick style → Mutate → Output (still template-based)
NEW WAY: Extract context → Generate dimensions → Build unique system → Output
```

**Every design is a one-of-a-kind creation. No templates. No menus. No presets.**

---

## The 6-Phase Generative Process

### Phase 1: Context Extraction

Before ANY design, answer these:

| Question | Extract |
|----------|---------|
| **WHO** | Audience - age, profession, culture, values |
| **WHAT** | Product/service - core function |
| **WHY** | Emotional promise - what feeling? |
| **FEEL** | Single dominant emotion |
| **ANTI** | What should this explicitly NOT be? |

### Phase 2: Dimensional Generation

Generate specific values (0-100) for 8 dimensions:

| Dimension | Low (0) | High (100) |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| **ORDER** | Grid-perfect | Broken grids, overlaps |
| **MINIMAL** | Few elements | Dense, layered |
| **WARM** | Earth tones | Blues, teals |
| **ORGANIC** | Curves, blobs | Sharp, geometric |
| **RETRO** | Past references | Sci-fi, futuristic |
| **PLAYFUL** | Fun, bouncy | Professional |
| **LIGHT** | Light mode | Dark mode |
| **DENSE** | Tight spacing | Generous whitespace |

**These create a UNIQUE fingerprint. No two designs have the same dimensional profile.**

### Phase 3: Element Generation

Generate colors, fonts, layout, effects FROM your dimensions:

- **Colors**: Warm/Cold → Hue, Light/Dark → Value, Playful/Serious → Saturation
- **Fonts**: Order → Structure, Organic → Humanist vs Geometric, Retro → Period faces
- **Layout**: Order → Grid strictness, Dense → Spacing behavior
- **Effects**: Chaos → Glitch, Retro → Scanlines, Organic → Morphing, Futuristic → Neon

### Phase 4: Signature Element (MANDATORY)

**Every design MUST have ONE completely unique element.**

Categories:
- Animation Signature (cursor trail, breathing elements)
- Layout Signature (horizontal scroll, diagonal dividers)
- Typography Signature (one word HUGE, vertical text)
- Color Signature (one "wrong" accent that works)
- Interaction Signature (unexpected hover reveal)

Ask: **"What would make someone remember this site tomorrow?"**

### Phase 5: Anti-Pattern Check

These are BANNED:
```
❌ Inter/Roboto/Arial on any design
❌ Everything centered with equal spacing
❌ Generic rounded corners everywhere
❌ Blue primary + gray secondary + white
❌ Standard Tailwind without customization
❌ Centered hero with H1, subheading, two buttons
❌ Three-card feature section with icons
❌ Any design that could be output by "make me a website"
```

### Phase 6: AI Detection Test

Before finalizing:
1. Would another AI generate this same design? → If yes, push further
2. Does it look like a ThemeForest template? → If yes, differentiate
3. Is there a clear signature element? → If no, add one

## The Manifesto

```
1. No two designs should ever be the same
2. Context determines dimensions, not style menus
3. Every design has a signature that makes it memorable
4. If it looks like a template, it's not done
5. Default fonts are creative surrender
6. The goal is: "I've never seen exactly this before"
```

**Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Use the generative system to create something that has never existed.**
