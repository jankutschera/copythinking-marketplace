# Copy Quality Frameworks

Two fundamental frameworks that ensure high-quality, influential copy.

## The Three-Question Test

**EVERY sentence must pass three questions:**

1. **Can I visualize it?** (Concrete vs. abstract)
2. **Can I verify it?** (True/false vs. vague)
3. **Can only WE say this?** (Specific vs. generic)

**Scoring:**
- 3× "No" = Bad copy
- 3× "Yes" = Good copy

### 1. Visualization (Concrete Beats Abstract)

People only remember concrete, visual terms.

**Memory test proof:** Participants remembered "Pitbull" and "Irish person" but forgot abstract terms like "better way."

**Process:** Refine terms until you have tangible, concrete objects.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "Regain fitness"
- ✅ "Couch to 5K"

- ❌ "Better way to work"
- ✅ "Your desk, 10 minutes after meetings end"

### 2. Verification (Proof Builds Trust)

Statements must be verifiable (true/false), not fuzzy.

**Examples:**
- ❌ "He's funny"
- ✅ "He looks like Ryan Gosling"

- ❌ "Industry-leading solution"
- ✅ "Processes 10,000 transactions per second"

### 3. Uniqueness (Own Your Position)

Use details only YOUR brand can claim based on specific positioning/audience.

**Example:** New Balance - "Worn by supermodels in London and dads in Ohio"
→ Only NB can say this because it matches their specific audience positioning.

**Your turn:** What can ONLY your brand say based on your unique positioning, history, or audience?

### Real-World Impact

**Copywriting determines success, not just product quality.**

**Case Study - Similar products, different results:**
- Snickers: World's best-selling candy bar
- Fuse: Discontinued in 2006
- Both products similar, marketing was different

**Case Study - Book sales:**
Dave Kitson (mediocre footballer) outsold Beckham & Gerrard by positioning as "The Secret Footballer" with insider stories.

## SPCL Framework (Hormozi)

Build influence through content by maximizing Status, Power, Credibility, and Likeness.

**Definition of Influence:** "High probability of compliance with requests"
→ The higher your SPCL score, the more people follow your CTAs and recommendations.

**Key insight:** These elements work individually, but maximize impact when combined (like how parents naturally have all four with children).

### S - Status

**Control scarce resources others want.**

Resources include:
- Money
- Knowledge/expertise
- Access to desirable people/places/opportunities
- Time/attention

**In content:** Show you control what audience wants
- Expert knowledge they need
- Results they desire
- Access to exclusive insights

### P - Power

**Say-Do Correspondence:** When you say something → people do it → they get results → they comply more in future.

**Build through:**
1. Make a claim/prediction
2. Others follow your advice
3. They get positive results
4. Probability of future compliance increases

**In content:**
- Share frameworks that produce results
- Give actionable advice that works
- Show track record of successful predictions
- Feature testimonials showing results from following your guidance

### C - Credibility

**Provable success + third-party validation.**

**Elements:**
- Demonstrable results
- Visible success markers
- Third-party endorsements
- Professional environments/contexts

**In content:**
- Show real business results (revenue, growth, scale)
- Use impressive backgrounds/settings in videos
- Include case studies and social proof
- Leverage credentials and achievements

### L - Likeness

**Similarity or sympathy through shared values, appearance, or personality.**

**Critical: Be authentic.**

**Emphasize your unique traits** rather than copying pre-made archetypes.
→ Real individuality creates more influence than manufactured personas.

**In content:**
- Share values that resonate with target audience
- Show relatable personality traits
- Be genuine about quirks and characteristics
- Find common ground with audience

### Application Strategy

**For maximum influence:**
1. Audit content against all four elements
2. Identify which elements are weak
3. Systematically strengthen each area
4. Integrate all four into content creation process

**Content should demonstrate:**
- Status: What scarce value you provide
- Power: Track record of results when people follow you
- Credibility: Proof and validation
- Likeness: Authentic connection with audience

**Remember:** These frameworks work together. Apply both the Three-Question Test to your sentences AND the SPCL Framework to your overall content strategy.
