# The Big-Four Persuasion Triggers

## Core Concept
Four emotions to convey as early as possible in your sales message. Each has a base word and a supercharger that amplifies its power.

**Origin:** Agora Financial's tested methodology, detailed in Kyle Milligan's "Take Their Money"

## The Big Four

### 1. NEW - The Pattern Breaker

**Purpose:** Bypass the "lizard brain" that categorizes and dismisses familiar content

**Why critical:** If the brain categorizes your copy as "seen before" = instant exit

**Core synonyms:**
- Revealed
- Announcing
- Discovery
- Game-changing
- Disruptive
- Breakthrough
- Revolutionary
- Never-before-seen
- First-time-ever

**Supercharger: "ONLY"**
- "The ONLY place you'll find..."
- "ONLY available here..."
- Why it works: Only = New by definition

**Examples:**
- "Breakthrough discovery in metabolism science"
- "The only copywriting method that ignores templates"
- "Revolutionary approach nobody else teaches"

### 2. EASY - The Friction Remover

**Purpose:** Eliminate fear of difficulty and feelings of inadequacy

**Why critical:** People avoid what seems hard; insecurity kills action

**Core synonyms:**
- Simple
- Automatic
- Foolproof
- Push-button
- Done-for-you
- No experience needed
- Step-by-step
- Effortless
- Anyone can do this

**Supercharger: "ANYBODY"**
- "ANYBODY can do this"
- "So simple ANYBODY can master it"
- Why it works: Anybody = maximum inclusivity

**Examples:**
- "Simple 3-step system anyone can follow"
- "Push-button solution requires zero technical knowledge"
- "So easy, my 67-year-old mother did it"

### 3. SAFE - The Confidence Builder

**Purpose:** Provide certainty and reduce perceived risk

**Why critical:** Safety makes offers feel more valuable and believable

**Core synonyms:**
- Proven
- Tested
- Guaranteed
- Time-tested
- Battle-tested
- Validated
- Verified
- 1,000+ success stories
- Risk-free

**Supercharger: "PREDICTABLE"**
- "PREDICTABLE results every time"
- "PREDICTABLY generates $10k/month"
- Why it works: Predictable = happened before, will happen again

**Examples:**
- "Tested on 1,532 businesses with 97% success rate"
- "Proven system used by Fortune 500 companies"
- "Predictable results backed by 10 years of data"

### 4. BIG - The Excitement Generator

**Purpose:** Create sense of significant opportunity or transformation

**Why critical:** Small promises don't motivate action

**Core synonyms:**
- Huge
- Massive
- Monster
- Enormous
- Game-changing
- Life-altering
- Explosive
- Unprecedented
- Astronomical

**Supercharger: "FAST"**
- "Massive results FAST"
- "Huge transformation in days, not years"
- Why it works: Big without Fast = not exciting

**Examples:**
- "10X your revenue in 90 days"
- "Massive transformation in just one weekend"
- "Explosive growth starting week one"

## Advanced Stacking Strategies

### The Power Stack
Use all four in your headline/hook:
```
"NEW [discovery] makes it EASY for ANYBODY to get BIG results FAST 
(PROVEN SAFE by 1,000+ users)"
```

### The Trust Ladder
Build credibility progressively:
1. Start with NEW (attention)
2. Follow with EASY (accessibility)
3. Confirm with SAFE (credibility)
4. Close with BIG+FAST (urgency)

### The Skeptic Crusher
For highly skeptical markets:
1. Lead with SAFE (proven results)
2. Support with EASY (low barrier)
3. Surprise with NEW (fresh approach)
4. Excite with BIG+FAST (worth trying)

## Market-Specific Applications

### Weight Loss (Sophistication Level 5)
```
NEW: "Scientists discover fat-burning gene switch"
EASY: "Activated by common spice"
SAFE: "Already helped 45,000 people"
BIG+FAST: "Drop 20 pounds in 30 days"
```

### Business Opportunity (Level 3-4)
```
NEW: "ChatGPT loophole creates passive income"
EASY: "Copy-paste these 5 prompts"
SAFE: "I've done this 47 times"
BIG+FAST: "$10k in your first month"
```

### Dating (Level 4)
```
NEW: "Psychological trigger discovered in brain scans"
EASY: "Three words activate attraction"
SAFE: "Tested on 5,000 interactions"
BIG+FAST: "Transform your dating life tonight"
```

## Supercharger Combinations

### Maximum Power Formula
Base word + Supercharger + Evidence:

**NEW + ONLY:**
"The ONLY place revealing this breakthrough (discovered last Tuesday)"

**EASY + ANYBODY:**
"So simple ANYBODY can do it (even my technophobe dad)"

**SAFE + PREDICTABLE:**
"PREDICTABLY safe returns (documented over 10 years)"

**BIG + FAST:**
"Massive results FAST (most see changes in 48 hours)"

## Copy Integration Points

### In Headlines
Lead with NEW or BIG:
- "Revolutionary Discovery Melts 3 Pounds Daily"
- "Massive LinkedIn Algorithm Change Creates Millionaires"

### In Subheads
Stack 2-3 triggers:
- "Simple, proven system anyone can use"
- "Fast, predictable results starting today"

### In Bullet Points
One trigger per bullet:
- "• NEW: Algorithm hack discovered last month"
- "• EASY: Just 10 minutes per day"
- "• SAFE: Money-back guarantee"
- "• BIG: Average user makes $5,000"

### In Guarantees
Emphasize SAFE + PREDICTABLE:
- "Predictably safe investment backed by our guarantee"
- "Join 10,000 others who safely transformed their lives"

## Common Implementation Errors

### Mistake 1: Claiming Without Conveying
- Wrong: Using word "new" without explaining what's new
- Right: "New algorithm discovered by MIT changes everything"

### Mistake 2: Big Without Fast
- Wrong: "Make $1 million" (when?)
- Right: "Make your first $10k in 30 days"

### Mistake 3: Easy Without Proof
- Wrong: "It's easy!" (says who?)
- Right: "So easy my 12-year-old did it"

### Mistake 4: Safe Without Evidence
- Wrong: "Totally safe!"
- Right: "Tested safe on 5,000+ users"

## Testing Your Triggers

### Trigger Audit Checklist
Read your copy and score each trigger:
- NEW: Is this genuinely different? (1-10)
- EASY: Would a beginner feel confident? (1-10)
- SAFE: Is there proof/evidence? (1-10)
- BIG: Does this excite you? (1-10)
- FAST: Is timeline specific? (1-10)

**Scores:**
- 40-50: Powerful persuasion
- 30-39: Good foundation
- <30: Needs trigger work

### A/B Test Priorities
Test in this order:
1. NEW vs. SAFE leads (which gets more clicks?)
2. BIG vs. FAST emphasis (which converts better?)
3. EASY in headline vs. subhead (where does it work best?)
