# COPYTHINKING: Persuasion & Psychology

This skill provides advanced psychological persuasion frameworks from George Ten's Copythinking methodology for creating emotionally compelling, high-converting copy.

## When to Use This Skill

**Primary triggers:**
- "How do I make this more persuasive?"
- "What psychological triggers should I use?"
- "How do I create a Big Idea?"
- "How do I build desire/emotion?"
- Sales pages, VSLs, launch sequences
- High-ticket offers needing emotional engagement

**Load this skill when:**
- Writing high-stakes sales copy
- Launching new products/offers
- Needing emotional resonance
- Creating "Big Ideas" for campaigns
- Building psychological momentum

## Quick Decision Tree

```
User needs psychological persuasion?
├─ "Make them buy" → Puppeteer Four
├─ "Create emotion" → Emotional Writing  
├─ "Big campaign idea" → Big Idea Framework
└─ "Proven triggers" → Big-Four Triggers
```

## Core Frameworks Overview

### 1. The Puppeteer Four
**Purpose:** Show reader you're on the same side
- Encourage dreams
- Justify failures  
- Confirm suspicions
- Throw rocks at enemies

**When to use:** Political speeches, manifestos, movement-building copy

### 2. Big-Four Persuasion Triggers
**Purpose:** Convey four core emotions early
- NEW (breaks pattern recognition)
- EASY (removes friction/fear)
- SAFE (builds confidence)
- BIG (creates excitement)

**When to use:** Headlines, leads, early copy sections

### 3. Big Idea Framework
**Purpose:** Create make-or-break campaign concept
- Must be NEW
- Must be BIG or FAST
- Must be EXCITING
- Must address main pain/desire

**When to use:** Campaign development, offer creation, angle selection

### 4. Emotional Writing Toolkit
**Purpose:** Create visceral reader experience
- Sensory words (sight/smell/sound/taste/touch)
- Emotional vocabulary
- Pattern interrupts

**When to use:** Body copy, stories, transformations

## Loading References

Each framework has detailed reference material. Load the appropriate file based on need:

### For Campaign Strategy
```bash
# Start with Big Idea - this determines everything else
cat references/big-idea-framework.md

# Then layer in persuasion triggers
cat references/big-four-triggers.md
```

### For Sales Page Psychology
```bash
# Use Puppeteer Four for positioning
cat references/puppeteer-four.md

# Add emotional depth
cat references/emotional-writing.md
```

### For Quick Improvements
```bash
# Just need psychological triggers
cat references/big-four-triggers.md
```

## Implementation Workflow

### STEP 1: Choose Your Big Idea
Always start here. Without a strong Big Idea, psychological triggers won't save you.

**Quick Big Idea Test:**
1. Is it NEW? (Nobody else using this angle?)
2. Is it BIG/FAST? (Impressive result or speed?)
3. Is it EXCITING? (Gets them emotional?)
4. Does it hit their main PAIN/DESIRE?

If any answer is "no" → rework the idea

### STEP 2: Select Psychological Framework

**For launching to cold traffic:**
- Start with Big-Four Triggers (especially NEW)
- Layer in Puppeteer Four for tribe-building

**For warm audience:**
- Lead with emotional writing
- Support with selected Puppeteer elements

**For high-ticket/complex sale:**
- Full Big Idea development
- All four Puppeteer elements
- Heavy emotional writing

### STEP 3: Layer Persuasion Elements

**In Headlines/Hooks:**
- Lead with NEW + BIG
- Support with EASY or SAFE

**In Body Copy:**
- Puppeteer Four throughout
- Sensory language for stories
- Emotional peaks and valleys

**In Closes:**
- SAFE (social proof, guarantees)
- EASY (simple next step)
- Urgency through BIG/FAST

## Quick Templates

### Big Idea Template
"[NEW mechanism] allows you to [BIG/FAST result] even if [address objection]"

Example: "Secret TikTok algorithm hack gets you 10K followers in 7 days even if you have zero video experience"

### Puppeteer Four in Action
```
DREAM: "You deserve to finally [dream outcome]..."
FAILURE: "It's not your fault [past failure] didn't work..."
SUSPICION: "You're right - [their fear] is real..."
ENEMY: "While [enemy] wants you to fail..."
```

### Big-Four Trigger Stack
```
NEW: "Revolutionary discovery..."
BIG: "10X your results..."
FAST: "In just 48 hours..."
EASY: "With one simple change..."
SAFE: "Join 1,532 others who..."
```

## Advanced Combinations

### The "Political Launch" Pattern
Combines all Puppeteer Four elements for movement-building:
1. Paint the dream future (encourage dreams)
2. Explain why they haven't achieved it (justify failures)
3. Validate their conspiracy theory (confirm suspicions)
4. Unite against common enemy (throw rocks)

### The "Breakthrough Discovery" Pattern
Stacks Big-Four for maximum impact:
1. NEW mechanism discovered (pattern interrupt)
2. Makes it EASY for anyone (remove friction)
3. Already proven SAFE (social proof)
4. Delivers BIG results FAST (excitement)

### The "Emotional Rollercoaster" Pattern
Uses sensory writing for engagement:
1. Open with visceral problem (touch/pain words)
2. Build desire with sensory benefits (sight/taste)
3. Create urgency with fear (sound/smell)
4. Close with emotional high (all senses)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Big Idea Mistakes:**
- Making claims without mechanism
- Choosing "me too" angles
- Being big but not new
- Being new but not exciting

**Puppeteer Four Mistakes:**
- Using only one element
- Being too obvious/heavy-handed
- Forgetting to encourage dreams
- Making enemy too abstract

**Emotional Writing Mistakes:**
- Telling instead of showing
- Using clichéd emotions
- Forgetting sensory details
- No emotional contrast

## Testing Your Psychology

### Big Idea Strength Test
Rate 1-10 for each:
- Uniqueness (how different from competitors?)
- Believability (will they trust this?)
- Desire (how badly do they want this?)
- Simplicity (can you explain in one sentence?)

Score 32+ = Strong
Score 24-31 = Workable
Score <24 = Rework needed

### Emotional Impact Check
Read copy aloud and mark:
- Where you feel excitement ✓
- Where you feel doubt ✗
- Where you feel nothing ⚬

Too many ✗ or ⚬ = Add more psychological triggers
