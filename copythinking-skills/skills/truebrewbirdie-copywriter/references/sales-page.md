# Sales Page Copy Structure

Write high-converting sales pages that guide readers from curiosity to purchase.

---

## Core Principle

> "A sales page is a handgun, not a machine gun. You have ONE shot."

Unlike emails (where you get unlimited tries), a sales page must convert on the first visit. Every element must earn its place.

## Section-by-Section Breakdown

### 1. Pre-Head (Optional)
Qualifies the reader immediately.

**Format:** "For [specific audience] who want [specific outcome]"

Examples:
- "For coaches who want to fill their calendar without cold DMs"
- "For SaaS founders stuck under $10k MRR"

### 2. Headline
The big promise. This determines if they read further.

**The "Question" Headline:**
> Want to [desired result]? Here's the [unexpected method] that works.

### 3. Sub-Headline
Expands on the headline, adds specificity or addresses a key objection.

> "Even if you [common objection], you can [result] in [timeframe]"

### 4. Lead Section
Hook them emotionally, show you understand their situation.

**The "Picture This" Lead:**
> Imagine waking up and [dream scenario]. No more [pain point]. Just [desired state].

**The "If/Then" Lead:**
> If you've ever [relatable struggle], then you know how frustrating it is to [consequence]. But what if I told you there's a way to [solution hint]?

**The "Story" Lead:**
> I remember staring at my screen at 2am, wondering why [relatable struggle]...

### 5. Problem Agitation
Make them FEEL the pain of staying stuck.

**Structure:**
1. State the problem
2. Show the consequences
3. Reveal hidden costs
4. Agitate the emotion
5. Hint that there's a better way

**Pain Amplifiers:**
- "And the worst part?"
- "But it gets worse..."
- "Here's what nobody tells you..."
- "The hidden cost of [problem] is..."

### 6. Solution Introduction
Transition from problem to hope.

**Bridge phrases:**
- "That's exactly why I created..."
- "After [experience], I discovered..."
- "There is a better way..."

### 7. Unique Mechanism
The "HOW" that makes your solution different.

**Formula:**
> "[Product Name] uses [unique mechanism] to [result], unlike [common approach] which [why it fails]"

**Example:**
> "The Snapshot Method uses story seeds from Reddit to generate email ideas in seconds, unlike traditional brainstorming which leads to writer's block."

### 8. Benefits Stack
Transform features into emotional benefits.

**Feature → Benefit → Emotional Benefit**
- Feature: 50 email templates
- Benefit: Never stare at a blank page again
- Emotional: Feel confident every time you write

**Use Bullet Formulas:**
Reference `copythinking-tactical/references/bullet-points.md` for 19 bullet formulas.

**Power Bullets:**
- The "If/Then" bullet for transformation
- The "Sneaky" bullet for curiosity
- The "Wrong" bullet for belief-breaking

### 9. Social Proof
Evidence that it works for others.

**Types:**
1. Testimonials (specific results)
2. Case studies (story format)
3. Logos/brands (authority)
4. Numbers (users, results)
5. Screenshots (DMs, revenue)

**Strong Testimonial Formula:**
> [Specific result] + [Timeframe] + [Before state] + [Name & Context]

Example:
> "I went from 0 to 23 email subscribers in my first week using the Snapshot Method. Before this, I'd stare at my screen for hours. Now I write emails in 10 minutes." - Sarah K., Health Coach

### 10. Offer Stack
Show everything they get, build perceived value.

**Format:**
```
Here's Everything You Get:

✓ [Core Product] (Value: $X)
✓ [Module 1] (Value: $X)
✓ [Module 2] (Value: $X)
✓ [Bonus 1] (Value: $X)
✓ [Bonus 2] (Value: $X)

Total Value: $X,XXX
```

### 11. Bonuses
Add unexpected value that addresses objections or speeds results.

**Bonus Formula:**
> Bonus #X: [Name] ($X Value)
> [1-2 sentences on what it is and why it helps]
> [Why you're including it for free]

### 12. Price Reveal
Frame the price against the value and alternatives.

**Anchoring Sequence:**
1. Remind of total value
2. Compare to alternatives (coaching, courses, doing it wrong)
3. Reveal actual price
4. Break down to daily/monthly cost
5. Show ROI potential

### 13. Guarantee
Remove risk completely.

**Strong Guarantees:**
- 30/60/90 day money-back
- "Try it and keep the bonuses even if you refund"
- Results-based guarantee

**Guarantee Copy:**
> "You're protected by my [X]-Day No-Questions-Asked Guarantee. Try [Product] for [X] days. If you don't [specific result], just email me and I'll refund every penny. You can even keep the bonuses."

### 14. Urgency/Scarcity
Real reasons to act now.

**Legitimate Scarcity:**
- Limited enrollment (capacity)
- Price increase deadline
- Bonus expiration
- Launch pricing

**NEVER fake scarcity. It destroys trust.**

### 15. Final CTA
Crystal clear next step.

**Button Text Ideas:**
- "Start [Result] Today"
- "Get Instant Access"
- "Join [X] Students"
- "Yes, I Want [Specific Benefit]"

### 16. P.S. Section
Catches skimmers. Repeat key points.
