# Email Storytelling (George Ten's 10-Minute Method)

Write storytelling emails that sell without feeling salesy.

---

## The Core Principle

> "A story is nothing more than a logical sequence of events."

The story itself is NOT what sells. The **AHA moment** inside the story is what sells. The story is just the vehicle to deliver that moment.

---

## The Email Structure

```
1. SUBJECT LINE (Open a loop or tease the AHA)
2. THE TEASE/LEAD (Promise something valuable, create vacuum)
3. THE STORY (Logical sequence of events)
4. THE CONNECTION (Bridge story to AHA moment)
5. THE AHA MOMENT (Perspective shift)
6. THE CTA (What to do next)
```

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prep Work (Do Once, Use Forever)

Create 3 lists with 20-30 items each:

**Their Beliefs:**
- What do they believe about your topic?
- What assumptions do they hold?
- What "rules" do they think are true?

**Their Objections:**
- Why wouldn't they buy?
- What excuses do they make?
- What fears do they have?

**Their Challenges:**
- What do they struggle with daily?
- What frustrates them?
- What keeps them stuck?

### Step 2: Find the AHA Moment

For each belief/objection/challenge, ask:
- How does my product BREAK this belief?
- How does my product SOLVE this objection?
- How does my product OVERCOME this challenge?

Each answer = One AHA moment = One email

### Step 3: Find Your Snapshot

A snapshot is a mental image that becomes your story seed.

**Sources for Snapshots:**
- Your own life experiences
- Movies you've seen
- Books you've read
- Stories you've heard
- Reddit r/WritingPrompts
- Daily observations
- Your imagination

**The Reddit Method:**
1. Go to r/WritingPrompts
2. Sort by Top (Week/Month/All Time)
3. Read prompts until one triggers a connection
4. Use that as your snapshot

### Step 4: Write the Story

Just write the logical sequence of events:
- This happened.
- Then this happened.
- Then this happened.

**No creativity required.** Just describe what happened in order.

Example (Home Alone):
> Kevin was bullied by his brother. The family treated him as irrelevant. They went on vacation and left him alone. He found out thieves were coming. He set up traps. They fell into the traps. They got arrested. Family came back.

That's it. Raw. Unedited. Boring. Perfect starting point.

### Step 5: Connect Story to AHA Moment

Use the "Kinda Like" approach:

> "It's kinda like when you..."
> "See, this is exactly what happens when..."
> "This reminded me of..."
> "Here's what I realized..."

Bridge the story to the reader's situation and your AHA moment.

### Step 6: Write the Lead/Tease

The lead comes BEFORE the story. It promises value.

**Two Framing Techniques:**

1. **Softeners** (Don't alienate readers)
   - BAD: "I'm sure you don't know..."
   - GOOD: "You probably don't know..."
   - BETTER: "You probably don't know... and even if you do..."

   Softener words: probably, might, perhaps, maybe, likely

2. **Zooming Out** (Include more readers)
   - Instead of "storytelling," say "writing"
   - Instead of "email marketing," say "marketing"
   - Use broader terms to not exclude interested readers

### Step 7: Add Open Loops & Connectors

**Open Loops (Create curiosity):**
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "I couldn't believe what happened next..."
- "Wanna know what I did?"

**Connectors (Maintain flow):**
- And
- Then
- But
- See...
- Here's the thing...
- Now...

### Step 8: Write the Subject Line

Take the juiciest part of your story or AHA moment and compress it.

**Subject line can:**
- Open a loop
- Tease the AHA moment
- Show weird contrast

Examples:
- "The $100k check" (Open loop)
- "Why hand-copying is killing your progress" (AHA tease)
- "Aliens and daily emails" (Weird contrast)

## Email Template

```
SUBJECT: [Juicy element from story or AHA]

[LEAD/TEASE - 2-4 lines]
Promise something valuable. Use softeners. Zoom out if needed.
Create a vacuum that makes them NEED to keep reading.

[STORY - Main body]
Start in the middle of the action (snapshot).
Write the logical sequence of events.
Keep it conversational.
Add open loops to maintain curiosity.

[CONNECTION]
"Kinda like..." or "Here's what I realized..."
Bridge the story to their situation.

[AHA MOMENT]
The perspective shift.
The lesson/insight/realization.
Make it specific to their challenge/objection/belief.

[CTA]
Clear next step.
One action only.
Link or reply instruction.

[SIGN OFF]
Your name
P.S. (Optional - add urgency or curiosity)
```

## Example Email (Annotated)

**Subject: The fortune teller's secret**

[LEAD]
There's a trick that fortune tellers use to make you believe they can read your mind.

It's the same trick that turns boring emails into money-printing machines.

I'll show you how it works. But first, let me tell you about Sarah.

[STORY]
Sarah paid $50 to see a "psychic" at the county fair.

The psychic looked at her palm and said, "I sense you've been hurt before. Someone close to you betrayed your trust."

Sarah's eyes widened. "How did you know?"

The psychic smiled. "I know many things."

Sarah spent another $200 that day on "readings."

[CONNECTION]
Here's the thing...

The psychic didn't know anything about Sarah. She used a technique called "cold reading."

She made statements that are true for ALMOST EVERYONE.

Who hasn't been hurt by someone close to them?

Kinda like when you write emails to your list...

[AHA MOMENT]
You don't need to know each subscriber personally.

You just need to know what's UNIVERSALLY TRUE about them.

Their beliefs. Their fears. Their dreams.

When you speak to those universal truths, readers think: "This person GETS me."

That's not manipulation. That's empathy at scale.

[CTA]
I put together a list of 50 "cold reading" statements for online business owners.

Use them in your emails, and watch your replies explode.

Talk soon,
George

P.S. Number 23 on the list has made me more money than all the others combined.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting with the story** - Always lead with the tease
2. **No AHA moment** - Story without insight is just entertainment
3. **Too long** - Keep it 300-500 words for daily emails
4. **No clear CTA** - Every email should have ONE next step
5. **Using facts as facts** - Use softeners to avoid alienating readers
6. **Writing to "everyone"** - Write to ONE person
