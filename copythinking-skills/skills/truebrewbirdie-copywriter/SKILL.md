# Copythinking Copy Writer

Write complete, conversion-focused marketing copy using George Ten's Copythinking methodology.

## CRITICAL: Copy Quality Standards

Before writing ANY copy, internalize these rules:

```
YOU MUST:
✓ Determine awareness level FIRST (Unaware → Most Aware)
✓ Lead with WIIFM (What's In It For Me - the reader)
✓ Use the "Kinda Like" connection to bridge stories to selling points
✓ Include at least one "AHA moment" that shifts perspective
✓ Write at 6th grade reading level (simple, clear, conversational)
✓ Create curiosity gaps that force continued reading
✓ End every piece with a clear, compelling CTA

YOU MUST NOT:
✗ Start writing without knowing the target audience
✗ Lead with features instead of benefits/emotions
✗ Write walls of text without pattern interrupts
✗ Use corporate/formal language
✗ Make claims without specificity
✗ Write "salesy" copy that screams "I'm trying to sell you"
✗ Skip the emotional hook and go straight to logic
```

## Quick Start

1. **Context** → Who is the reader? What's their awareness level?
2. **AHA Moment** → What perspective shift will make them want this?
3. **Copy Type** → Select template from `references/copy-templates.md`
4. **Write** → Follow the specific structure for that copy type
5. **Edit** → Apply 5-part editing framework

## The Copythinking Framework

### Step 1: Know Your Reader (MANDATORY)

Before writing a single word, answer:

```
1. What is their AWARENESS LEVEL?
   □ Unaware - Don't know they have a problem
   □ Problem-aware - Know the problem, not the solution
   □ Solution-aware - Know solutions exist, not your product
   □ Product-aware - Know your product, not convinced
   □ Most-aware - Ready to buy, need the right offer

2. What are their BELIEFS about this topic?
   (List 3-5 assumptions they hold)

3. What are their OBJECTIONS?
   (List 3-5 reasons they wouldn't buy)

4. What are their CHALLENGES/STRUGGLES?
   (List 3-5 problems they face daily)
```

### Step 2: Find the AHA Moment

The AHA moment is WHY they buy. It's a:
- Lesson
- Realization
- Perspective change
- Insight
- New discovery

**Ask:** How does this product/service...
- Play into or break their beliefs?
- Solve their objections?
- Help overcome their challenges?

### Step 3: Build the Connection

Use the "Kinda Like" approach:
1. Start with a story/scenario the reader relates to
2. Connect it to your AHA moment using "kinda like..." or similar bridge
3. Show how the AHA moment applies to their situation
4. Make the product/service the logical next step

## Awareness-Based Copy Approach

### Unaware → Use Indirect, Story-Based Copy
- Lead with entertainment/curiosity
- Story that mirrors their situation
- Reveal the problem through the story
- AHA moment creates awareness

### Problem-Aware → Agitate the Problem
- Call out the problem directly
- Show you understand their pain
- Amplify consequences of inaction
- Introduce solution category

### Solution-Aware → Compare & Differentiate
- Acknowledge they know solutions exist
- Position your unique mechanism
- Show why other approaches fail
- Present your approach as the answer

### Product-Aware → Benefits & Proof
- They know you, now convince them
- Stack benefits with specificity
- Social proof and testimonials
- Overcome final objections

### Most-Aware → Offer & Urgency
- Skip the education
- Lead with the deal
- Create scarcity/urgency
- Make buying frictionless

## The 7 Golden Rules of Copy

1. **WIIFM Always** - Every sentence must answer "What's in it for me?"
2. **6th Grade Level** - If a 12-year-old can't understand it, rewrite it
3. **Specificity Sells** - "Lost 23 lbs in 6 weeks" beats "lose weight fast"
4. **Curiosity Gaps** - Open loops that demand closure
5. **One Reader** - Write to ONE person, not "you guys"
6. **Conversational** - Write like you talk to a friend
7. **Single Focus** - One idea, one offer, one CTA

---

## Open Loops & Curiosity Seeds

### 3 Types of Open Loops:

**The Question:**
- Are you following along?
- Wanna know what happened next?
- Does that make sense?

**The Statement:**
- But there's more...
- And this is where it gets interesting...
- I'll tell you about that in a second.

**The Incomplete Thought:**
- I got the idea but didn't know what to do next.
- This is where everything changed.
- I couldn't believe what I saw.

### Connectors (Keep Momentum):
- And
- Then
- But
- See...
- Here's the thing...
- Now, this is important...

## The 5-Part Edit (After Writing)

### Part 1: Elements Check
- Is WIIFM clear in the first 2 lines?
- Is there a compelling hook?
- Is the CTA clear and specific?
- Are there pattern interrupts (subheads, bullets)?

### Part 2: Clarity Hunt
Remove or replace:
- Pronouns without clear antecedents
- Big words (use simple alternatives)
- Unnecessary qualifiers (very, really, just)
- Passive voice
- Adverbs ending in -ly

### Part 3: Flow Enhancement
- Add curiosity seeds before dense sections
- Insert open loops to maintain momentum
- Smooth transitions between paragraphs
- Ensure each line leads to the next

### Part 4: Headline Story Test
- Read only headlines/subheads top to bottom
- Do they tell the complete story alone?
- Would someone skim and still understand the offer?

### Part 5: Read Aloud
- Read the entire piece out loud
- Mark every stumble point
- Rewrite until it flows like natural speech

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER Write These)

```
❌ "We are a leading provider of..."
❌ "Our innovative solution leverages..."
❌ "Dear Valued Customer..."
❌ Long paragraphs without breaks
❌ Feature lists without benefits
❌ Generic claims anyone could make
❌ Multiple CTAs competing for attention
❌ Assuming the reader cares about you
```

## Quality Gate

Before delivering ANY copy, verify:

- [ ] **Awareness Match**: Does the copy match the reader's awareness level?
- [ ] **AHA Moment**: Is there a clear perspective shift?
- [ ] **Emotional Hook**: Does the opening create curiosity/emotion?
- [ ] **WIIFM**: Does every section answer "what's in it for me"?
- [ ] **Specificity**: Are claims concrete and believable?
- [ ] **Flow**: Does it read smoothly out loud?
- [ ] **CTA**: Is the next step crystal clear?

**If you can't check all boxes, revise until you can.**

## Philosophy

> "Copythinking before copywriting."

Every piece of copy starts with understanding, not writing. Know who you're talking to, what they believe, what they fear, and what they dream about. Only then do you write. The best copy doesn't feel like copy—it feels like a friend who understands your problem and has the solution.

**Think first. Then write copy that sells.**
