### Positioning Sorcery

Positioning.

Positioning in a nutshell means "how you CHOOSE to put your product on
the imaginary shelf of products you're competing with".

Let me explain.

Let's imagine you chose to sell soap to elderly women who have skin
problems.

Good. You're already ahead. Because your non-copythinking-copywriter
competitor just decided to sell the soap to EVERYONE.

YES!

Now we need to understand how to position the product. The soap.

How will my target audience (elderly women with skin problems) REMEMBER
my product?

For this we need to answer a couple more questions.

1.  What problem am I solving?

Am I solving ALL skin problems? A specific one?

2.  What's the END result they're buying?

Are they buying a no-Acne-baby-smooth-like-skin? Or are they buying pain
relief? Look better? Feel better? WHAT ARE THEY BUYING?

3.  What's UNIQUE about the product I'm selling?

Do I have anything unique? The shape? The color? The smell? The
manufacturing? No-toxic-materials?

4.  Does my target audience CARE about what's unique about my product?

Do they care it smells good? Do they care that the shape is easy to hold
in their hand?

5.  What's my competition doing?

Are my competitors positioning their products using ANY of the choices
I've made about my positioning?

6.  Is there a GAP in competition?

Is there something my audience wants that my competitors are not
addressing?

7.  Does my audience BELIEVE me?

If I say that my soap helps with their skin problems... Do they believe
me? Is the claim too aggressive? Maybe I should scale the claim down?
Maybe it "soothes the skin" instead of "eliminates skin problems"?

8.  How do I make my audience believe me?

Do I need to show them a doctor? A doctor they know? Maybe a study? What
do they ALREADY believe in that I can just show them?

Now...

Only AFTER you've thought about all of those...

Now...

Is when you can write copy.

Almost.

Because you still need framing.

Go to the framing module Now. Now. I mean it. Do it NOW. You need to
know this.

### Framing Reality

Framing reality. What does that mean?

Look.

We are not liars. We don't lie in our copy. But... we BEND reality.

Or in other words? FRAME reality.

Framing is the art of saying what you want your audience to understand.

Complicated? Not really. Let me show you.

We're still selling that piece of soap.

And we've decided on the market.

And the positioning.

So let's imagine we're selling to elderly women with Acne problems on
their skin. On their face. Good.

What our product does is help reduce the effects of Acne in 30 days.

A good offer. Our audience wants that. YES!

Now.

Look at how we can take this sentence and frame it differently.

"Reduce the effects of Acne in 30 days"

Let's break this sentence into two:

"Reduce the effects of Acne" and "in 30 days".

"Reduce the effects of Acne".

How can we frame this same sentence differently?

• Help with the effects of Acne

• Smoothen the effects of Acne

• Hide the skin irregularity

• Ease the pain of the skin

Etc etc.

This is endless.

And then we can do the same with the second part: "in 30 days".

• In 4 weeks

• In a month

• Within 30 days

• Within a month

• Before 30 days pass

• Before a month passes.

Etc etc.

But there's more to framing.

This was the basic level.

The more advanced level is HIDING or PUSHING forward the points we want
to.

So for example: Same soap.

It's FDA compliant. We have that information.

Do we write it on the product description page?

Do we hide it?

Here's the case for writing it: It could give you a potential advantage
over others who don't have an FDA certificate (let's imagine a non-US
market). A selling-point.

Here's the case for not writing it: It could scare off potential buyers
who have never seen other soaps with an FDA certificate so they might
think yours is potentially dangerous.

Every product needs framing.

Every product has advantages. And disadvantages.

It's our job to figure out what's the best way to frame reality around
our product to make it as desirable as we can.

### The rule of one

Hey, let\'s talk about the rule of one for a second. Okay. Essentially,
the rule of one means that we want. So imagine a line going through your
sales message, whether it\'s a sales page or an ad, whatever. Okay. Any,
any type of copy may be except for email marketing. Okay. But imagine a
sales page, right? Imagine a line going in the middle of your sales
page.

That line should connect everything. Meaning you\'re speaking to one
person. You\'re giving them one solution to one problem. And then we can
go as far as to, say, selling through one emotion with one main benefit.
Whatever. Okay. It depends on how far you want to take this concept of
rule of one. So and I see a lot of questions and I saw that before as
well.

People asking well, but what if my, product has, multiple features or
what if my product has several different types of readers or whatever?
Right. Or maybe, hey, what if I can sell my product through several
different emotions? So let\'s say you can sell through anger, through
fear, through jealousy, or even through pleasure or whatever. Right?

Let me show you one kind of example off the top of my head. I\'m going
to completely it right now with you. To show you what I mean
specifically me, my methodology of how the rule of one works. Okay. So,
for example, you know that or you don\'t know that. Usually a sales page
consists, will be consisted of parts.

Okay. There are parts to the sales page. So for example, let\'s say that
those are the first four. Let\'s say it\'s a hook and then a lead and
then a problem again. And then body copy. Let\'s just imagine right. So
for example let\'s imagine that our hook is one. Whatever our lead is a
positive lead. So pleasure. And then the problem is where we, tailor
prospect about their problem.

So you could say hey, but if the lead is positive then how come we can
use the negative emotion in the problem? Dig in, for example. Right. Let
me show you really an example off the top of my head. Let\'s say we\'re
selling copywriting. And let\'s say that the main emotion that I want to
use, so one target audience person who wants to become better at
copywriting, that we can obviously niche down inside out, we can do many
things with this, but let\'s just imagine something general.

As someone who wants to get better at copywriting. And now let\'s say
that my mechanism to get them better at copywriting is through hand
copying. Other people\'s sales pages. Let\'s imagine, even though I\'m
not a big believer in that, let\'s just imagine off the top of my head,
right? And let\'s imagine that the emotion I want to use here is
jealousy.

Let\'s just imagine, right? So then let\'s say that the hook is, I want
to know how to effortlessly, write copy, just like, just like all the
A-list copywriters. Well, now you can. Whatever. Let\'s say it\'s a good
hook. Let\'s, let\'s let\'s imagine we don\'t have sophistication levels
and blah, blah, blah. Okay, then let\'s use the positive lead here.

Imagine if you could, sit down at your laptop and immediately come up
with ideas and write the whole sales pitch in 30s, just like the A-list
copywriters. Imagine, how easy it would be to, pump out copy work for
your clients, and then you can take more clients. Imagine. Imagine.
Imagine. Okay. Imagine if you could,

No. No. How to do the market research in in minutes. Just like, Agora
Financial, copywriters do. Now, I don\'t know if that\'s true. And this
is just an imagination, right? So imagine you could do market research
in minutes, just like Agora people do. Right. So, see, it\'s a positive
lead. Imagine if you could write.

Imagine if you could have this in your life. But we\'re using jealousy
in the bullet points. Now, we don\'t even have to use our jealousy in
all of them. And then we go into the problem again. So, hey, do you
always feel frustrated that you cannot whatever. Right? While you cannot
write the sales page in 30 minutes while you see others pumping them out
like it\'s like it\'s bread and butter.

Hey, you read the books, you watch your videos from all the great
copywriters on Twitter or on YouTube or whatever, and somehow they can
always come up with a big idea in one frickin second, blah, blah, blah.
And then, okay, we\'re moving to the bulk copy, right? Which is a lot of
times it\'s objection handling, right. So, hey, and you might tell
yourself, in order to be like those copywriters, like those crazy
copywriters, crazy good copywriters, you need to, have experience in
several different industries.

And you have you needed to to be writing copy for the last 15 years?
Well, that\'s not the case, because although they did, there is another
way to do this mechanism. For example, right hand copy, blah blah blah.
Explain. Right. Whatever. So you see, I took you through the whole sales
page using one emotion, which is jealousy, right?

And you can use that emotion in positive. Any negative. It doesn\'t
matter okay. But hey what if you have several different features or
whatever? Here\'s the the gist of the rule of one. The rule of one does
not say that. You cannot say, hey, you can learn how to do market
research, but also how to write copy, but also how to come up with
hooks, but also how to whatever.

How do you get to write, copy or whatever, right? It does not mean that
we need we cannot have several different bullet points or several
different features of several different whatever. All it means is that
we need to lead with one. Okay? We don\'t want to confuse the reader.
And if we start going several different directions. So offering several
different products, just like for example, hey, if you say on the sales
page, in one part, you say get a free nutrition plan.

And then after that you say, join the challenge. You\'re breaking the
rule of one, right? You\'re offering two different solutions to two
different problems, potentially. Right. So the whole idea of the rule of
one is to just keep it in a straight line to make, to make think about
it as a conversation when you\'re talking to your friend.

Right. And they say, hey, I have this problem. You could offer several
different angles to look at it. We could offer several different, ways
to solve it. But you\'re solving one problem for one person, and you\'re
sort of, getting back to that every time you speak. So, you know, hey,
you want to get a visa here, right?

I\'m all about visas right now because I\'m getting a visa right now. So
that\'s the best example I can come up with off the top of my head. Hey,
you want to get a visa and you\'re not sure where to leave? I get it, we
have this one lawyer here who helps us with them. But you also don\'t
know what what kind of documents you need.

I get it, I get it. It feels awful. But, hey, this one lawyer can help
you. And, hey, I know you\'re not sure if you can rent a car here, but
that lawyer knows, you know, so we can have several different sort of,
like, problems or features or whatever bundled up into one solution.
That\'s all I wanna I want to show you here you can use several
different elements.

You don\'t have to. Hey, one feature, one emotion, one person. Don\'t be
a robot. Just make sure that it\'s sort of like an arrow head going in
the same direction, okay? Hey, you\'re in. The community will be able to
critique much, a lot more of your copy. We\'re going to have to, we can
we can, we\'re going to be able to look at much, many more examples.

So you\'ll get the hang of it. I just wanted to sort of, like, break
that myth that you can not have several different features or several
different benefits or whatever in one sales page or one message. You can
and you probably should in most cases, but you can still use them
through one main message, if that makes sense.

### Messaging & Framing

Hey, let\'s talk about messaging in framing. Now, I\'m not sure that
that\'s the best way to describe what I\'m gonna tell you here, but
here\'s the best way to describe it. Heavier message marketing message.
And also the people you\'re targeting, aligned in a way that would get
you the best kind of customers that you want or leads or potential
customers or whatever it is.

Okay. Now what I\'m going to tell you here works for everything. Okay.
It works for social media, Twitter, Instagram, whatever. It works for,
ads. It works even for called outreach. It works for everything. Okay,
so think about it this way. A lot of people and you see this a lot with
big accounts, right? So you see big accounts, on Twitter, for example,
who, who keep pushing content about, so for example, on Instagram, it\'s
at this time it\'s there\'s this trend of, five websites that feel
illegal to know or like on Twitter.

It\'s like, I don\'t know, five tools to start your solopreneurs, your
business. Right. So and you see big accounts using that and it works.
And it has to do with the copy matrix. Right. Hopefully you went through
the, the course and you understand that essentially it\'s targeting an
unaware audience. But even worse than unaware, it\'s also targeting an
audience that is very in the very beginning.

So, you know, each stage for customers, for a customer, for ourselves.
So for example, if I\'m before building a business, I still can be a
problem where solution A where anywhere. If I have my first client, I\'m
still I can be unaware. Problem word solution are to what you\'re
offering. If I have an agency with 100 people, I still can be unaware.

Problem or solution? Work right to what you\'re offering. So if we look
at awareness levels, there is also sort of like a subsection of
awareness levels. And that\'s let\'s call it the customer journey where
the person is right now. In the big scheme of things. Right. So back to
the big accounts with the illegal websites and all that BS.

And if you\'ve been following me or in this community for some time, you
know that I very much attack those people. And it\'s not because I\'m
jealous of them because they have a ton of followers. It\'s because I
know many of them. Many of them are in my DMs, in my telegram, in in our
zoom call, like I, I speak to that one zoom and they always come to me
and say, hey, I cannot convert my buyers.

All the leads I\'m getting are irrelevant and people don\'t have money
and and blah, blah, blah. And the reason for that is the messaging and
framing of theirs. Okay, now I\'m going to show you a couple of
examples. Hopefully you didn\'t focus on this while I was talking. So
let\'s look at an example for Twitter or for social media, for example,
of messaging and framing.

Right. So if you say how to get your first client, what are you
assuming? The only people who will mostly read this are people who
don\'t yet have their first client. Yeah. So and that\'s why I always
laugh at people who make a ton of content about that, because what are
you actually doing? You\'re attracting people who most of them are
broke.

They don\'t have the first client. Yes. Or even if they\'re not broke
and hey, they just, stepped out of a corporate position and they have a
ton of money, right? They\'re usually bad clients. If, if, if they\'re,
they\'re they didn\'t do anything in business yet. If they didn\'t,
start anything yet, then essentially what they are looking for is they
hire you for someone to do the heavy lifting for them.

Right. And we all know that going from 0 to 1 is much more difficult
than going from from, one, two to 8 to 10, for example. Right. Or from 9
to 10. Right. It\'s it\'s much more difficult to make your first dollar
online than your million dollar online, right, because you already have
something working for you when you already have clients.

Right? So those are just terrible clients, right? And that\'s what most
of us are attracting, okay? Most of us, most of the creators, most of
the ads, most of everything, that\'s what we\'re doing. Okay. A better
way to do this would be how to use existing clients to find more. For
example, this is just an example, because then you\'re assuming that the
person who\'s going to read this already has clients, but they\'re
struggling to find more, meaning they already have money, they have
experience, they have understanding.

It\'s going to be much easier to get them. The result? Yes. Let\'s look
at another example of how you can use your messaging to disqualify
people. Okay. Which is even more important than qualifying. If you ask
me. Okay. So for example, let\'s say that you\'re running Facebook ads
and you have a small product, a tripwire product, let\'s say \$7, \$17,
27, whatever.

But your goal is at the end of the final, let\'s imagine, is to sell
them a high ticket mastermind or to sell them your service of, hey, let
me run ads for you. Just an example, right? Or let me build funnels for
you right? If your, your your your offer, your product is get a swipe
file with a hundred hooks.

Who are you targeting here? And you see this all the time on Facebook
ads, right. Super entry level. Offers products. Okay. It could be a paid
product or a free product. It does not matter. So essentially, the
people you\'re targeting here are people who are still in the phase of,
how do I figure out my hook for my sales page?

They\'re most likely not even running anything right now. The most
likely don\'t have anything working for them right now. Now, that\'s not
always the case. Some of you watching this could come and say, hey,
George, but I\'m interested in hooks and I would probably buy it. And I
do have a business. Yes, but you\'re in the minority, okay?

Because if you switch the the bait, the low ticket product, the three
point product into a swipe file with 100 ups sells, most of the people
you would get in this scenario are people who already have a sales page
that is selling. Otherwise they would not be interested in, getting
their upsells to work. Right. And this has a lot, a lot to do with,
called outreach as well.

The clients that we pick to work with it has to do with everything.
Okay. Like I said, if you\'re going from 0 to 1, if you\'re taking a
person from no business, for example, in the in our niche, in this case,
if you\'re taking a person with no business and trying to get them a
business, it\'s going to be much more difficult than taking a client who
is already spending \$100,000 on ads.

Right. And you\'re just, hey, I can scale you to \$150,000 and pay me a
fraction of what I make you. For example, so, so easier to close the
client. It\'s also easier to structure a good deal. That is a win win
deal. They don\'t take any risk or the risk is on you. Right. But if, if
you get the result and then you also get paid more.

So hopefully that part makes sense. And another thing that we need to
assume when we\'re doing all of this okay. Two things. Number one, we
can assume that people who we want are buyers. If they\'re not buyers,
we don\'t want them because they\'re most likely not going to buy. Yes,
we also so let\'s let\'s stop on that for a second.

Right. People who are buyers are buyers. People who are not are not. And
that\'s why if you, for example, in your landing page, in your sales
pitch, let\'s say you have a landing page, schedule a call, right? And
you\'re saying if you want to try therapy for the first time and see if
it works for you, you\'re attracting the people who have never bought
before.

And then you are in a sea of trouble because you\'re getting the the,
the people who have never spent money on something. And if they\'re not
spending money on it, it\'s not that burning problem for you. Right? And
the second point is, if we\'re looking for ideal clients, okay. For
example, right. It works the same with, social media, with, with ads,
with everything.

But let\'s just focus on looking for clients. Right. And I, spoke about
this in the past. If you want a client that is going to be easy to sell
to, easy to close. While you can also get them a good result, you want
someone who is already spending money or at the very least, some,
ungodly amount of effort, mostly money into your direct or indirect
competition.

I mean, so what that means if you are a ghostwriter, for example, right.
And you want the good clients, the clients that will pay more easily,
blah, blah, blah, you would want a target. People who are already using
a ghostwriter. Okay, maybe they\'re not happy with their current
ghostwriting for for a specific reason. Whatever it is, right? They\'re
already spending money on it, so they\'re already spending \$2,000 a
month paying someone.

If you have a different offer, a better offer and more whatever, better
offer that that is more compelling to the buyer, they will switch to
you. Why not? Right, if they\'re currently unhappy with their current,
ghostwriter? Another example is indirect competition. Remember, we want
someone who is already spending money on some kind of solution to their
problem.

We can call this indirect competition. Let me give you an example of
indirect competition. If someone is currently spending money on Twitter
ads, then we can assume for growth, right? For growth, we can assume
that we can assume because it\'s true. The result that they want is
growth. They want to grow their account and they\'re spending money on
it.

That means it\'s important. They\'re already in the game. They\'re in
the field they\'re playing. Right. So if you come and say, hey, you\'re
currently spending \$2,000 a month on ads, just for example, right. And
you\'re getting a thousand followers about if you pay me the same
\$2,000, I\'m not only going to get you more followers per month for the
same money, but I\'m also going to have a higher quality followers.

I\'m also going to, brand you in a better way, position you in a better
way so that when you want to sell something, it\'s easier to the current
followers, right? So essentially when we look at the big, scheme of
things, we need to think about who we want to attract, right? And then,
fit the messaging and framing of what we\'re doing and the offer,
obviously, into what that potential buyer would be interested in in
order to attract that specific type of buyer.

Let me give you another example that I know, very personally, if you\'re
let\'s say that you\'re targeting your thing called DMs called, outreach
and you\'re targeting startups, let\'s say you\'re targeting SAS
startups. And you want to offer them Facebook ads. You want to run
Facebook ads for them, right? Who is it better to target? Is it better
to target startups or SaaS businesses who are not yet running ads at
all, or those who are already running ads, but they\'re not happy with
the results?

Think about it for a second, right? The whole idea here is to think
before we do it. Because if you do this thinking right, according to
what I\'m telling you here, everything else falls into place. You don\'t
need as much, persuasive copy. You don\'t need as much, hard selling on
the calls. You don\'t need as much anything.

Everything is downhill after you figure out the thinking part, which is
why you\'re here in this community. So thank you for.

### Positioning

Hey, let\'s talk about positioning for a second. I see that\'s a topic
that\'s very interesting to many of you. And you were also discussing it
a lot. So for that we have the copy thinking triangle. That\'s how I
look at it personally. Okay. Now, these are just, indicators. Okay. I\'m
going to I\'m going to explain what I mean.

So in my methodology in my book, we have three ways to position and an
offer or ourselves. Okay. Three ways. Number one is your product or you.
Number two is the market. And number three is the competition. Okay.
Ignore this for one second. I\'m going to explain it by the end of this
video. Let me just explain what this means.

So essentially positioning in other words we can call it
differentiation. Now please don\'t confuse differentiation with
betterment. Okay. There are two different things. We don\'t want to be
better necessarily. We just want to be different. Okay. In most cases we
can combine the two. And which is best being better and then us being
different. And then a byproduct of that is being better.

Right. So let me show you what I mean by that. So the first thing to do
to to to position yourself is you or your product. Or in other words,
what\'s unique. What\'s different about you or your product. Here\'s a
quick example. Copy thinking. That\'s how I use this triangle to
position myself. I am different or my product is different.

Okay. I look at this whole copy writing thing in a different light.
Okay. I don\'t believe in templates. I don\'t believe in a lot of
things. Right. So I positioned myself using me. Okay. Using how I am
different. And then as a byproduct of that, all of my products, all of
my offers, all of my services, whatever it is, are a byproduct of my
positioning me.

Okay. It can also work the other way around. It doesn\'t have to
necessarily be you. It can just be your product. Your product can be
different because of your different skill sets. So for example, we sold
the, singing course where the guy who sold it. The creator who, the
presenter, the creator, he had a different approach.

He believed. And now I know that this is not going to make sense to
everyone. Especially if you\'re not into singing. He believed that in
order to learn how to sing, you don\'t need to, first learn about vocal
registers. In other words, vocal registers are. And this is my limited,
very limited knowledge of this because I\'m not a singer myself.

I\'ve never been and never been interested in that. But hey, we sold
that product. So I needed to learn a little bit about, what we\'re
doing. So essentially, you have different voices, right? You have a
voice that comes from your head, a voice that comes from your chest, a
voice that comes from your stomach. Maybe, maybe I\'m wrong.

You have a mixed voice, whatever that means, I don\'t know. So
essentially, he believed that in order to get the result, which is to
sing better, you don\'t necessarily have to break those off, unlike how
everyone else is doing it. So we use him or his methodology is, set of
beliefs in order to position the product that way.

And it worked. Let\'s talk about the market now. The market. When I see
the market, I mean, about, I mean your audience or more importantly,
what\'s happening in the market. So a quick example for this can be, the
financial market, right? You can position your product according to
something that is happening in the Agora.

Agora, for example, financial, newsletters, they do this all the time.
They position products using what is happening now in the market
inflation rate, recession, blah, blah, blah. Right. So this is one way
or another way is what\'s happening in the actual person\'s business,
for example, or in their life. Let me give you another example. In I
think our first cohort, we had, a guy, a really great guy who was trying
to sell, emails for e-commerce.

Right, as not as a service bus, but as a, as a, sort of like a swipe
file or whatever. Like you get my best performing emails after working
with a ton of big companies. So then I asked, the group, how do you
what\'s the best way to position that product according to the market?
And, pretty much all the responses I got were, well, if you sell it
before Christmas, then you say, hey, Christmas is your best, best, month
to sell emails because you\'re going to make the most amount of money.

And I asked him the question, this question, and I said, what happens if
you\'re selling after Christmas, after Black Friday, after Cyber Monday,
after after Christmas? The ones of you who\'ve done e-commerce or know
anything about e-commerce stores are the biggest three, sale days,
right? You sell a ton with these days. So I said, what happens after?

Okay. And, nobody could give me what happens if you\'re trying to sell
after Christmas this product, how to, like, send emails and make money
like the my best emails if you\'re if you cannot connect it to an event
in the in your market\'s life okay. So and I didn\'t get any good
answers as far as I remember.

And then I gave them my answer. Okay. What\'s happening in your market
that you\'re selling to after Christmas is that most stores start
scaling down. You know this if you\'ve done e-commerce, right. So
you\'re scaling, scaling, scaling, Cyber Monday, Black Friday,
Christmas, boom, Christmas ends and you scale down your campaigns.
Right? So, I have my own personal story, where I scaled an e-commerce
store to \$67,000, in, in one day, after Christmas.

And the way I did this was using emails, right? So if you can tell that
story, then you can essentially position your product as the Savior
after Christmas. So, hey, everyone\'s scaling down, but you can frickin
scale up right now because the emails give you more, more revenue, more
cash flow, more cash flow to actually scale the campaigns as well.

Right? So you can build a story around that and position using what\'s
happening in the market right now. Okay. Now you can also do it through
competition. Right? So for example, if you\'re looking at competition is
the hey everyone is doing this one thing, okay? Everyone is talking
about the same thing. You know, in my market I don\'t have a really good
example right now.

But hey, let\'s let\'s take just a throw, right? For example. Right. So
let\'s say that every single one and you\'re somehow selling, fix to
raise men\'s. This test run. Right. So if everyone is, talking, talking
about like how to raise this tester on testosterone may be a good way to
position the product would be by saying, hey, here\'s why you don\'t
need to this test thrown in order to get the benefits, right?

Because, anything that we\'re trying to do is connected to an end
result, to the benefits that you get when you\'re able to do this right.
When you raise your testosterone, you get more whatever energy,
whatever. So you can look at competition, say, hey, if everyone is doing
that, I can do the opposite. I can find the gap.

This is what we\'re doing essentially in the copy thinking triangle in
positioning. We want to find that gap to sell. Okay. This is what we\'ve
done with, when you position through yourself for your product, this is
what we\'re doing when we position through the market. This is also what
we\'re doing when we position through the competition, okay.

We we\'re finding that gap. If everyone is doing something and there is
a gap there. Now, what I just give you is a very obvious. Yet sometimes
when you look at competition you you\'ll find less obvious gaps. I
cannot give you a good example right now, but hopefully, throughout the
community we\'re going to see some examples of yours and we\'re going to
find it together.

And then I\'m going to be able to show you how to do this. So when you
find it, again, through competition, that\'s also a good way to position
your product. Right. So for example, everyone\'s saying, hey,
testosterone because that\'s going to give you more energy. And then you
can come and say, hey, you don\'t need testosterone to get more energy
and this and this and this, like they promise you through the system and
you actually need.

And then comes your mechanism, right? You actually need serotonin.
Whatever. Maybe you, this is just an example. I don\'t understand enough
about this. And then you can show some studies, for example, that prove
that, hey, the University of New York, blah, blah, blah published a
study and said, blah, blah, blah. Huberman published a study that this
test run is not this, but actually you need that whatever.

Right? So you can position through your competition. Now, let me run.
You will, quickly through those. Okay. This is more relevant when we\'re
doing code shopping, okay. Because, most of my career I\'ve done code
traffic. I\'ve never had, like a following on, on on my social media
like I do now. So essentially when you position to yourself, okay,
usually your scale and, I actually got some, people asking me what scale
means.

Scale means selling more. Okay. Scaling your budgets, selling more,
essentially targeting like, sort of like being able to convert the
bigger, audience, let\'s call it that way. Usually when you position
yourself through this. And that\'s why I, suggest you try this first.
And. And this is why I use this, order. This is actually the order.

Try this first. If you cannot, then try this. And only if you can not
try this. The reason for it is when you position through yourself, your
scale is usually broader, bigger. You can usually convert to more
people. Okay. When you\'re, position yourself through your market, it
can be one of 2 to 1 of two ways, okay.

But it will most likely you will most likely be able to scale less than
if you position three you or your product. And when you do it through
competition, then it will usually. Now this is just guidelines. It\'s
not always true okay? It\'s not true in every single scenario. But
usually your scale will be narrower. Okay. I hope this makes sense.

We\'re going to discuss this more if it doesn\'t fully pay. You know,
I\'ve been doing this for years, a lot of years teaching and
implementing myself. So if you don\'t fully grasp the idea, that\'s
fine. Ask, ask us questions, get on our lives and we\'re going to, dive
deeper into this. Thank.
