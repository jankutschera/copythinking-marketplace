## The Copy Matrix **Module 1. Awareness levels**

If we look at this real quick, we\'ll see that there are five awareness
levels, and they start from the bottom to the top.

We\'re dealing with:

-   Unaware

-   Problem-aware

-   Solution-aware

-   Product-aware

-   And Most-aware

![null](media/image1.jpeg){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.8680555555555554in"}

Now, let\'s go through them quickly, and then I\'ll show you some
examples.

**Unaware**:

These are the people who have no knowledge of their problem, but they
may be feeling some symptoms. Don\'t worry; I\'ll explain everything.

**Problem-aware**:

They\'re aware that they have a problem - But don't know that there is a
solution.

**Solution-aware**

They know of different kinds of solutions to their problem.

**Product-aware** 

They know about your specific product. 

(Unlike solution aware where they have different kinds of solutions...

This is a specific solution. Your solution. Your product.) 

But they don't necessarily want it yet.

**Most aware**: 

They know all the details about your product and they want it.

Okay, so let\'s focus on the first three. This is important for you to
understand.

*Unaware, problem-aware, and solution-aware.*

The closer to the left we are, (meaning to unaware), the bigger the
audience is. 

So unaware audience is bigger than the problem-aware audience, which is
bigger than the solution-aware audience.

![null](media/image2.jpeg){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="0.8465277777777778in"}

The closer to the right we are, (solution-aware), the easier they are to
convert to sell to. 

Meaning the closer to the right (solution aware), the smaller the
audience is. The closer to the left (unaware), the more difficult they
are to convert. 

it\'s a trade-off, right? And I\'m going to show you in the next couple
of videos how you can choose where you want to play the game.

So let me give you an example.

You\'re marketing an offline business, a massage place.

**Unaware people** are those who don\'t seem to have a problem. 

*They do have a problem*, but they\'re just living their life and
they\'re unaware of it. They might notice some symptoms. (Symptoms could
be neck pain, back pain, anxiety, an uncomfortable feeling in the body,
stress, etc...) But they\'re not aware of those problems, right?

For **problem-aware people**, it\'s the same people who are just at the
next stage. They suddenly became aware of their problem, (for example,
neck pain).

How? Usually something happened.

The problem (in this case neck pain), became stronger, or their spouse
brought their attention to it, or maybe they noticed that they can\'t do
certain activities because of the neck pain. 

Maybe they saw an ad or some educational content about their problem, so
they became aware of the problem.

Problem-aware, right? But believe it or not, they are not thinking about
the solution at this stage. They\'re just all about the problem.

**Solution-aware people** now know that there is a solution to the
problem. How? Something happened, someone suggested they go to a
professional, or they read about a solution somewhere, and maybe the
problem became so painful that they actively went on a spree to try to
find the solution.

Let\'s stop here. There are two more awareness levels, but we\'ll talk
about them later. Okay?

Let\'s look at how we would market to each one of those three awareness
levels. 

**Unaware:**

They *don\'t know that they have a problem* and or are experiencing some
symptoms. 

So what would an ad look like to those in that stage? Let\'s say with
some stress. Here\'s an example of a hook for an unaware audience who
might have symptoms of stress:

\"Want to tap into the little-known secrets the world\'s most calm
people (think Buddhists) used to keep their minds worry-free.\"

Don\'t get stuck on this. I\'m just going to go through them, and then
I\'m going to explain, just in case you need more information here.

**Problem aware:**

They are *aware of their problem*, again, stress (that's the problem):

\"How to get rid of stress using a little exercise that takes less than
three minutes a day that you can do even while driving.\"

Just an example. 

And then...

**Solution-aware:** 

They are aware of their problem *and also know that there are
solutions*. Just don't know YOUR solution yet:

\"97% of Americans voted this tiny device named Muse is their best
solution to reduce stress within three minutes or less. Here\'s how it
works.\"

(T/N: This is just an example. Muse is a real product but I don\'t
really know if it really reduces stress in 3 minutes.)

Let's stop here.

Another way to look at this...

Again: Unaware, problem aware, solution aware.

![null](media/image2.jpeg){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="0.8465277777777778in"}

Is that the closer to the left we are (unaware), the more indirect our
approach should be. The closer to the right (solution-aware), the more
direct our approach should be. 

Can you look at the same hooks we\'ve just written before and see how we
go from indirect for unaware to a bit more direct for problem-aware, and
then to super direct for solution-aware?

Look at them again:

**Unaware:**

\"Want to tap into the little-known secrets the world\'s most calm
people blah blah blah"

So look how indirect this is.

It's not "YOU" are experiencing a problem. There are some secrets.

Very vague. Very indirect. Not threatening.

**Problem-aware:** 

(now remember. We're talking about how direct our messaging is) It'll be
more direct than unaware:

\"How to get rid of stress using a little exercise that takes less than
three minutes a day that you can do even while driving.\"

So you see. From "little-known secrets" we go to "How to get rid of
stress".

Or in other words we could have written here "How YOU can get rid of
stress. Okay?

So it's more direct. We're speaking to the person about his problem.

And now,

**Solution aware:**

Look at this:

\"97% of Americans voted this tiny device named Muse is their best
solution" Right?

Now this might be framed as "they voted" But we can also say: this tiny
device named Muse is the best way for you to reduce stress" For example.
Right?

So see how we move from an indirect approach to a direct approach as the
awareness levels go up. 

Meaning. For solution-aware for example, we actually said the name of
the product. We said what the solution is. "This is the solution". It's
shorter. And you will see the ads later. How it actually looks like.

It's more direct. It's shorter. We don't need to explain that much.

This is the solution. Boom. Ok?

But that\'s not all; there\'s much more. In the next module, I\'ll show
you what to write for each awareness level, and we will dig a bit deeper
into the psychology of it. We\'re building this step by step. I want to
let your brain soak in the layers. Okay, we\'ll be building this in your
head. So I\'ll see you in the next module.

**Module 2. Pt 1. Unaware**

In this module, we\'re specifically going to talk about unaware. I\'m
going to show you some examples, and we\'re going to break it down.
Okay, so what to write for each awareness level?

In this case, unaware. They don\'t know anything, remember? **They
don\'t know they have a problem**. They don\'t know by definition that
there is a solution, and they have no clue about you or your solution,
company, product...

Here\'s a quick list of what to write for the unaware:

-   Secrets

-   Tips

-   Stories

-   Symptoms

But it could be any of those and a big list of other things.

You will find unaware ads that start with things that are not listed
here. Okay, because it\'s impossible to list all of them, and that is
why we need to understand. And not follow some template or some rules or
whatever. We need to understand.

So we want to *make them aware of the fact that they have a problem*.
This is the whole purpose of unaware. catch their attention and then
make them aware.

Now let me introduce a website for you. It\'s called
[dig.com](https://digg.com/) It's a website to find endless amounts of
unaware ads/content.

Not everything there will be unaware. Most of it will.

We'll discuss it later as well - Why that's like that.

I want to show you some examples from that site.

You can go there btw and swipe hooks. They're great at what they do.

Let me show you some hook examples:

"​​What we never say about parenting."

Now regardless wherever that's an ad or a piece of content. Whatever it
is...

If it was an ad, think about it this way - It could potentially lead to
*anything that is parenting-related*.

Literally any solution depending on the problem that they will present
in the article.

Or sales page. Whatever it is.

Let me show you another example.

"The best Amazon pics in February chosen by you".

Very indirect. That's how we know it's unaware. This ad could turn out
to have, you know, "Here's a list blah blah blah and the BEST pick for
February 'link' buy now" Right?

For example. Very unaware.

Look at this "the cost of retirement around the world map".

Right, very unaware. It\'s not where 'YOU' should live for retirement or
where can 'YOU' afford your retirement or what\'s the best place for
'YOU'? Right. It\'s very unaware. Just the cost of retirement around the
world map.

What could this ad be leading to? So think "How to get a citizenship in
the lowest-cost retirement in the world?", right? 

We\'re taking people from unaware (They don\'t even know that there
might be a better place for their retirement) to showing them the
problem that their country is a lot more expensive than other countries,
and then presenting a solution "you can get a Visa if you have this and
that whatever requirements"  Right?

And then schedule a call with us, (just an example).

Now you can go to again. It\'s [dig.com](https://digg.com/).

Play around with it. It\'s a great resource.

Now, let me introduce **Facebook Ads Library**. I don\'t know how many
of you know Facebook Ads Library or how it works. We can discuss that,
but I'm going to show you some ads that we found that are unaware. 

And actually, we\'re gonna play around with the screen size a bit here
just in case.

So, just look at the hook: 

"Want to know how I left my nine-to-five to become a stay-at-home mom
and make two to three thousand dollars per week in passive income?"

Very indirect. There\'s no \"you\" here, there is no problem here. An
implied problem and an implied symptom. That you\'re a stay-at-home mom
and you want to make some money.

Ok, unaware. Let's move on

And we\'ll see these ads a million times in this course. Okay, don\'t
try to stop and read all of them; be with me, okay?

Another indirect ad:

"Here\'s what they don\'t tell you about leadership when you step into
the role." Curiosity-based, very indirect. Not selling you anything... 

Unaware. Yeah?

Let\'s move on.

"Imagine your child making great plays, scoring points, and bringing
home the win for their team".

Just a plain statement, a bit of desire. If you go to the list on top,
you\'ll see that pretty much all of these ads fit into one of the topics
that I listed above. Very indirect. Yeah, unaware.

"Nearly 60% of leaders feel used up at the end of their workday,
according to the Global Leadership Forecast 2021".

Yeah. Okay. 

You know it\'s not saying: "YOU" feel used up, which is your problem.
That's already a problem aware, right? 

But in our case it\'s just a statement. Yeah, unaware.

"As a leader, you\'re required to navigate your way through some pretty
tough terrain"\...

Again, unaware.

"I started six, yes, six businesses in about ten years. I wish I could
say they were all successes, but some were epic fails. While I learned a
lot, I certainly know that I could have saved years of time, effort,
moola (money. If you don\'t want to know what that means.) If only I had
known a bit more at the start."

**Basically saying nothing**, right? Just curiosity, very indirect.
It\'s not how you should start a business. Yeah.

Okay.

"If I needed to get a new client today, what would I do?"

That\'s it. A question, curiosity, very indirect.

It\'s not about how 'YOU' would get your client today. Yeah, okay.

Now, for this part, I know and understand that *some of you will get
confused between unaware and problem aware*. 

First of all, I need you to know that that\'s fine. We all get confused.
I somehow sometimes get confused. Sometimes when I speak with my peers,
I\'m like, "No, it\'s problem aware", they\'re like, "No, it\'s
unaware".

Don\'t get caught up with your ego trying to be the best at
understanding awareness levels. You just need to understand the
concepts. Okay, but here\'s a general list of differences.

-   *Unaware is more indirect*, just like we said, so it\'s less about
    you; it\'s usually about how 'they', how 'I', and it\'s not about
    you and your problem. Yeah.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   *Umaware is also usually softer*. It\'s very soft, very vague.
    Okay. Softer and longer. 

Because in order to get people from unaware to problem aware to solution
aware, you\'re adding one more section that if you were writing for
problem aware, you wouldn\'t need, right? 

So you can judge by the length of an ad. This is unaware just because
it\'s so long compared to other ads from the same advertiser. Let\'s be
clear here.

-   *The pain in unaware is weaker* because in unaware ads, they might
    be feeling symptoms, but they\'re not actually aware of the pain. So
    if you go straight into the pain, they don\'t feel it yet.

So let\'s change our thinking from now on. Okay.

**"People don\'t buy products; they buy solutions"**.

Meaning an unaware person cannot buy because they\'re not aware. Neither
can problem aware because they\'re not aware of the solution. So they
literally cannot buy.

*The only people who can buy are solution aware people*, or in other
words, the purpose of unaware is to move the prospect into problem
aware, and problem aware moves the prospect into solution aware.

The sale will only happen if the prospect is solution aware. We\'ll talk
about this more later. And that is why all of your copy, the copy
you\'ll see, will get people to be solution aware. Some people will
start with unaware, some with problem aware, and some even start with
solution aware straight away. But **all of them will get the prospect to
be solution aware**.

Thank you for this module. I\'ll see you in the next one.

**Module 2. Pt 2. Problem aware**

Part 2: What to write for each awareness level? 

This time, problem aware. Problem-aware people are those who **know that
they have a problem** and it hurts. They have experienced some 'aha'
moment. (To go from unaware to problem aware), they understand that they
have a problem. They feel the need, and they\'re more motivated to find
the solution. 

And they *found the reason for their symptoms or desires*. We\'re going
to talk about that. So what to write? 

-   Name a need.

-   Pain points.

-   Anxieties.

-   Benefits. 

-   Educate them. 

Okay, we want to **show that we understand their problem**. We want to
show that we have empathy toward their problems or the current
situation. And we want to educate them more.

Let's look at the unaware ads again. The same ads okay?

Now tell me if you can find where the ads turn from unaware to problem
aware. 

Here\'s how you do that: 

You ask yourself: "What the problem is and how are they using the list
above in their copy?" So this list, yeah, one of those (name a need,
Pain points, anxieties, benefits, or you educate them), okay. Let\'s
look at the ads again. 

I\'m going to give you a minute here before I tell you where the problem
starts.

"Here\'s what they don\'t tell you about leadership when you step into
the role, it\'s lonely at the top. Leadership can be an incredibly
lonely and stressful place. You often have information that you can\'t
share with everyone."

I will not continue reading because there is already a problem.

"It\'s lonely at the top. It can be lonely and stressful". And then, if
you read this, "there are times when you have the context for things",
blah, blah, blah. 

You see when he says the word \"you\" he is already talking to you. So,
in most cases, this is already problem aware. Okay. Now, if you keep
reading, you\'ll see that he agitates the problem more and more. "At
times the pressure, isolation, and weight can feel overwhelming", blah,
blah. He digs into that.

Let's keep going.

"Nearly 60% of leaders feel used up at the end of their workday,
according to blah blah blah.... Are you one of them? If so, stop working
harder to squeeze more work into your day and start working smarter.
It\'s a cliche for a reason".

So, we can see that the problem starts here. "Are you one of them?"
Again, 'you', okay. Boom, 'you' indicates us to understand that there\'s
probably a problem coming. "Stop working harder to squeeze more work".
Yeah, problem. "Working harder". 

And then again, "if you\'re on the edge of burning out", agitates it a
bit more. 

Let\'s keep going. 

"As the leader, you\'re required to navigate your way through some
pretty tough terrain. You have to deal with making tough decisions,
communicating through ambiguous and complex situations, blah, blah. And
while you\'re busy doing all of this, you\'re also ultimately
responsible for leading your team to achieve their KPIs and deliver
exceptional value to your organization. Sometimes it can get so
overwhelming\...". 

So you see how it\'s somewhat mixed up. We cannot specifically pinpoint
where the problem starts, but we understand that it\'s a problem. He\'s
talking about you. You could say he\'s talking about your pain points,
right? Let\'s keep going. 

"Who else wants an easy way to start Spanish conversations and keep them
flowing? As you know, small talk is not so small. It\'s a big part of
connecting for an enjoyable life. Nothing is worse than making a new
friend and finding yourself tongue-tied." 

Yeah, 'yourself'. Boom. Okay, problem: 'tongue-tied'. Yeah, *the words
\"you\", "yourself" are a great indication to tell us the problem is
starting here*. Let\'s move on. 

"Protect and grow your wealth for a secure retirement. Are you worried
about outliving your savings?" Boom. Already started, 'you'. 

Now look, we could say that the whole ad starts with problem aware. I
think it starts with unaware. Okay? "Protect and grow your wealth for a
secure retirement" I think it's unaware. But you could claim that it'\'s
problem-aware, and we would both not be wrong. This is just to show you
how sometimes it can be tricky. Don\'t get caught up on that. Yeah.
Okay. Look.

**We\'re going to shift our thinking again.** 

We can look at awareness levels as part of the two sides of the funnel,
any funnel, okay? This may not always be true, but I want you to be able
to differentiate it in your mind.

Unaware and problem-aware are first touch.

Problem aware and solution aware are second touch. 

Or in other words, Unaware and problem-aware are acquisition (Ads, for
example). Problem-aware and solution-aware are retargeting. Okay?

I\'m going to show you a great example for this soon.

I don\'t want you to get too caught up and say "Oh I'm not sure how this
works". I just want your brain to be able to differentiate it, okay?
First touch, second touch, acquisition, retargeting.

I\'m going to show you a funnel if you\'re a bit confused by that.
Don\'t worry; I\'m going to show you exactly how it works. 

Now, this doesn\'t mean that solution-aware ads won\'t work for
acquisition. They will, depending on the industry and the awareness
levels within that industry, but it will not scale as far as the
previous two awareness levels.

So. Just like we discussed before, 

Unaware and problem-aware - You will be able to scale on the first
touch. On acquisition... 

But solution-aware, you will probably not be able to scale for
acquisition. Yeah, for acquiring new customers. 

Problem-aware is in both places because it can be used both... Let me
show you the funnel. 

**A mental funnel:** You run an ad for an unaware audience. They don\'t
buy. 

But they might know that they have a problem already. So you can
**retarget** them with a problem-aware ad.

You could also write a problem-aware ad for **acquisition**. And then
retarget them (if they don\'t buy) with another problem-aware ad or with
a solution-aware ad. 

I just wanted you to understand that because you\'ll need it for the
next steps in the program. Okay. So thank you for listening to this
module. I\'ll see you in the next one.

**Module 2. Pt 3. Solution aware**

Hey, welcome back to module 2, part 3. What to write for each awareness
level? Solution-aware.

Now.

Solution-aware people are those who **know that they have a problem**.
They also know that there are solutions, right? 

This is where their research phase begins. They're actively looking for
solutions, and there are many solutions. They're convinced that they
need a solution. They're not sure your solution is the best for them.

And they don't necessarily want to spend money at all. Okay?

So here's what to write in solution-aware.

-   Social proof

-   Case studies

-   Testimonials

anything that gets them to believe that your **product is the solution
best fit for them**. What we want to do is to show your product can help
them solve their specific problem, and that your product is different
and possibly better compared to other solutions.

And we want to show them others with the same problem who found the
solution in your product.

Okay now. I\'m going to show you ads right now.

When we're going to look at the ads, you'll see how ads that start as
unaware through problem aware to solution-aware will mostly not have any
of those. (social proof, case studies, testimonials) Okay. I just want
to show you how to spot where solution-aware begins.

And then I'll show you some solution-aware ads that start with
solution-aware and end with solution-aware, right?

You will see that some of them use those elements. (social proof, case
studies, testimonials)  A lot of them don't, but if you look at the best
advertisers, you'll see that most of them use some combination of those
elements or all of them.

So let's look at the unaware ads again and tell me, can you find where
the problem-aware copy turns into solution aware copy? What the solution
is? How it's presented? And does it do any of the things in the list
above? (social proof, case studies, testimonials) Okay, let's look at
it.

"Want to know how I left my nine-to-five to become a stay-at-home mom
and make two to three thousand dollars per week in passive income? And
without, without, without...

Many moms would love to stay at home..."

And then, you see how it transitions into, "I'll teach you exactly how
I..." This is where solution-aware begins.

This is where they *present the solution*, and you will see this pattern
throughout all the ads that we'll look at.

You'll see that switch the pivot point. 

Let me show you a couple more so you understand. 

"Here's what they don't tell you about leadership when you step into the
role.

It's lonely...Leadership can be\... Blah blah blah... But here's the
good news. It doesn't have to be this way".

And then "I want to share this with you". So, the solution aware starts
somewhere here.

You see the transition. Right?

Let's show you some more. 

"Imagine your child making great plays, scoring points, and bringing
home the win for their team. That's exactly what our overnight Elite
Skills and Leadership Camp was designed to do".

Yeah, "that's exactly". See the transition?

Now, as you can see, they are using some social proof, right? Using the
names of famous and good basketball players like Jim Butler, Kyrie
Irving, Steph Curry, Chris Paul, and Tony Parker, Kobe Bryant.

Okay, let's look at a couple more. And then I'll show you the
solution-aware ads. Okay,

"Nearly 60% of leaders feel used up at the end of their workday."

Blah, blah, now if we just skim... we\'re like boom, okay, "THE BURNOUT
FIX".

You see he has actually put it in caps. He highlighted the solution
part. Let's keep going.

"As a leader, you're required to navigate your way through some pretty
tough terrain, blah, blah, blah, blah\...So what can you do? *Join the
free leadership Level up masterclass*"

Transition again:

"Did you know that you can get thousands of your best dream customers to
visit your website every month?"

We scroll down. Okay. Boom. "I put all these secrets together." Yeah.

Or you could say that it starts somewhere here. "Over the years, I've
tested out hundreds of different strategies", or "Since then, I've found
over 30 plus different traffic strategies." Okay. So essentially, we
could say that it starts here, the solution-aware part, right?

"If I needed to get a new client today, what would I do? Blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah. I have created this simple formula."

You can literally skim through ads and immediately see where the
solution-aware part begins. 

Okay. **Let me show you some solution-aware ads** starting with
solution-aware and ending with solution-aware. 

You see "this unique" when you see the word "this", he's talking about
his product, which means it's solution-aware.

"This unique strategy method improves muscle flexibility and joint
mobility using simple, intelligent"

Yeah?

Let's look at it again.

"Do you want to master the art of hypnosis?"

So you see, we could say that this starts as semi-unaware, but you see
the second line already says the name of the academy. "Jaquin Hypnosis
Academy".

Yeah, so it's like immediately solution-aware. Now, again, you can stop
the video, read through the ads, or look at the file alone when you're
not watching this video. 

**The idea here for me is to show you how you can spot those**. You can
literally go to Facebook Ad Library and find a million different sales
pages. You can do the same with other tools, okay?

"Want a rewarding career in hypnotherapy helping others?"

Again, we could say that it's not exactly solution-aware, but then the
third line, okay, "Academy", right? Okay, solution-aware.

This is like in your face,

"A thousand-plus Chat GPT mega-prompts to streamline and scale any
business. Get your ebook now".

Ebook. Okay, solution-aware right away. Okay, "get a thousand prompts",
right?

So all I want to show you here is how the solution-aware part plays in
unaware or problem-aware ads that lead to solution-aware.

And then how you have solution-aware ads that are just solution-aware. 

Okay, I'm gonna see you in the next lesson, which is going to be in my
eyes the most interesting one.

**Module 3. The sales page\
\
**Hey, welcome to Module 3 - the sales page. 

This is where all the pieces start connecting, Like I said before.
We\'re building layers. We\'re trying to show you the full picture, and
it takes some time and patience.

The sales page, (or the next phase of the sales message) meets the
prospects where they are. **Most sales pages begin as problem-aware or
solution-aware**, usually not unaware. 

Usually, it will start as a solution-aware page. Okay? Sometimes, you
start as problem-aware. 

Let me show you some examples.

So. Look at this hook: 

"My first reel got over a thousand views, and I only have 208
followers". 

You should already understand what awareness level this is. Just from
reading this. If we scroll down\...

Okay, let me actually show you this. She\'s starting from testimonials. 

"I ended up filming like 16 in an hour". "I finally did it. I shared my
first reel video". "How would you feel if\... and that\'s why I\'m
hosting a three-day video creation bootcamp".

And then, when we look at our sales page: 

![null](media/image3.jpeg){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.8784722222222223in"}

"Three days, three steps, three videos sales". "Reel of fortune". A nice
play on words. 

"A live video creation boot camp with Alice Darma. Short-form videos
aren\'t just for trendy songs and dance routines; videos are incredible
for sales". 

"I\'ll be hands-on with you as we kickstart your video creation
strategy, so your short videos bring in actual leads, customers, and
sales. You\'ll walk away with three videos ready to be published... For
only 10 bucks".

So, if you didn\'t guess before, the ad was Unaware. Again you can
scroll back with the file that you'll get with this video. And you can
see that the ad is unaware, it turns into problem-aware, turns into a
solution-aware, and then it sends to a sales page that is
solution-aware. 

Now, this might confuse you a little bit. So the next module is going to
clarify things if you\'re a bit confused.

But let me show you some more examples. 

"Learn smartphone content creation in 14 days at home, wearing your
pajamas". 

What awareness level is this? I\'ll wait...

Look. This is the sales page:

![null](media/image4.jpeg){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="3.7215277777777778in"}

 "How to create professional videos using your smartphone in just 14
days". What awareness levels are both?

**Solution-aware ad sends to a sales page that is also solution-aware**.
That\'s it. That simple.

But look at the ad on the next page from the same creator. So, this is
this creator we\'re talking about.

Which awareness level is this ad targeting?

"Want to create YouTube videos that stand out from the crowd?"

What awareness level is this?

Look, it\'s a problem aware ad.

But where is this ad leading when you click?

Same page. Solution-aware page.

And that brings us to the next lesson: one sales page, multiple ads.

Each ad can start from a different awareness level.

And they all end up with a solution-aware stage leading to a
solution-aware sales page. 

All I\'m trying to tell you is this: *You don\'t necessarily have to
build different sales pages for different awareness levels*. 

You just target the ads to start from unaware. Some ads start from
solution-aware, some ads start from problem-aware, but they all lead the
prospect into the solution-aware stage and then send to a sales page
that is solution aware. I\'ll actually show you a great example in the
next module, so stay with me.

**Module 4. Product aware & Most aware**

Hey, welcome to module 4. Product aware and most aware. 

Up until this point, the prospect has not really been interested in YOUR
product. 

Until you present your product/solution/service. This makes them product
aware. 

**The moment you present it, they're aware of your product.** But let's
back up for a second.

Let's show you a specific example here. I want to show you how that
funnel looks like. 

Imagine this with me:

You made a Twitter account. You're UNAWARE of everything that's
happening. Then you read a thread that tells you how you can get more
clients from Twitter by growing your account.

Now you become problem aware because you understand that you have a
problem, and you need to grow your account. You tried to tweet some
stuff and even write some trends, but no traction. 

When suddenly, you see a flashing icon on your iPhone. It's your inbox;
New message, "Hey, bro, we can grow your account using our ghost-writing
skills. We'll write EVERYTHING for you."

So now, you became solution aware. You now know there's a solution to
your problem. You ask the ghost-writing guy, "How much do you charge?"
The moment he answers, you become product aware.

So. He says "\$2,000 per month". You go on with your day, thinking that
maybe that's too much. But the next day, another ghost-writer in your
inbox, same pitch. But this one says, "I promise you'll get 3,000
followers per month if you pay me \$2,000 per month." So now, you're
considering.

Remember this story; we'll get back to it a lot.

**A product aware prospect knows you have a product and offer a service,
but it doesn't necessarily want it yet.** He's still in shopping mode -
In research mode. 

That's why in order to push a prospect at this stage, you need to throw
benefits at them, you can also: 

-   Share free content

-   Show reviews

-   Show product comparisons with other solutions.

You want to put your best foot forward and show the prospect that *your
solution is best for them in their specific situation*. Because when you
push them off that fence they're sitting on, they become most-aware. 

Now they know everything about you, your product, your offer, and they
want it. But there is one last question: details. What is the deal? I
give you money, and what do I get back specifically?

Let's get back to the story.

You're on Twitter; a thread got you from unaware to problem aware,
remember?

A DM got you to product aware, and then you got another DM from a
ghost-writer. This one got you interested because he promised you that
you would get 3,000 followers, which is better than the previous one
(comparison). 

"So what kind of content will you write? How can I tell my story with
your writing?" Yes, a couple of questions, we can also call them
objections.

And he sends you to his sales page that has all the answers. And still,
you decide not to buy. What can this ghost-writer send you to make you
finish the purchase? A guarantee, a bonus, a free trial, a better offer,
a discount, right?

Now, this was just a short example to show you in real life how that
works. Okay? It works in everything. It works with emails, with cold
ads, with content. It works with video. It works anytime you come in
contact with your potential client. It doesn't matter what channel, what
media, what industry\...

That funnel will always happen. The only question is if it will happen
with you or with someone else. Where do you catch that prospect in their
journey of awareness?

Let me back up again and actually show you this point. 

Remember how the guy, (you, in this case) joined Twitter, and you were
unaware, and then you read a thread. 

That thread showed you that there is a problem, right? And then a
ghost-writer got into your DMs and showed you that there is a solution.
Yeah?

It could be that the guy who wrote the thread that got you from unaware
to problem aware is the same guy that sent you the DM, or maybe you DMed
him.

But it could also be that it's a different person. Someone else got the
prospect to be at a higher awareness level. 

(So from unaware to problem aware or from problem aware to solution
aware), And then you just **caught them at the right moment**. 

So now think about how this applies to essentially everything. Think
about how it applies to cold emails, emailing your list, think about how
it applies with content.

It's the exact same thing; just the tactics matter, and we're gonna have
a bonus on this topic. So I'll tell you how all of this connects, but
that's not what the next module is for. Because there is still one
missing piece of the puzzle. If you don't get that piece, everything I
taught you so far doesn't matter. So I'll see you in the next one.

**Module 5. Sophistication levels**

Hello and welcome to Module 5: Sophistication Levels, which is my
personal favorite module because I see people get this wrong time after
time, even more than awareness levels. I think this is just as important
and probably even more important.

You\'ll see why in a second. Look at this graph. You\'ve probably seen
it in the past, but I want to show you how I look at it from my
perspective.

![null](media/image5.jpeg){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="4.061111111111111in"}

So, there are **five levels of sophistication levels**, just as there
are five levels of awareness levels, and that\'s why you shouldn\'t
confuse them. But you\'ll see that in a second. We\'ll talk about that.

Um, and the main difference between level 1 and level 5 is the
skepticism of your prospects, or in other words, how many times they\'ve
seen ads on the topic, or we can also think about it as how many
solutions there are presented to that prospect.

So, this is just a quick recap. It\'s very simple. 

**Level 1 -** Is birth of the market. A new market arrives, you just
make any claim, just make a claim, say that you can get people any
result in that new market.

**Level 2 -** Is just making the claim bigger because there\'s now a
little bit more competition. So, just make the claim bigger, promise a
better promise, a bigger promise. That\'s it.

**Level 3** - It\'s no longer enough to just make a bigger promise. So
you need a mechanism, a mechanism that offers a logical reason why your
claim is achievable.

**Level 4 -** Is where you create a BETTER mechanism or an upgraded
version of the previous mechanism. I know this is vague, but I\'m going
to show you a specific example. Stay with me.

**Level 5 -** Is when the market\'s level of skepticism is at its
maximum. It\'s so high that they no longer believe in Mechanisms. Okay,
new advanced marketing strategies must be activated.

Think of sophistication levels as an equation of two things. 

-   How many ads do your prospects see in your market? 

-   And how skeptical they are?

The more ads, the more skepticism. It's that simple.

So, let me show you an example. Let\'s take the weight loss industry as
an example, a market that\'s at the sophistication level five.

How would we write if it was at level 1? Same market: "How to lose five
kilograms?" 

How would we write it if it was at level 2: "How to lose 5 kilograms in
seven days effortlessly?" right? Just make a bigger claim.

What would we write if it was at level 3? It\'s no longer the claim that
matters. It\'s now the mechanism, so a "New capsule allows you to lose
five kilograms within seven days, even if you keep eating pizza and
burgers", right?

What would we write if it was at level 4: a "New capsule that
deconstructs fat cells DNA allows you to lose 5 kilograms, blah blah,
blah". Same promise.

But what if we write it if it was at level 5?

\"I tried to pick up my grandchild and couldn\'t bend over. My belly was
in the way,\" right? I\'m going to explain that.

This is why I keep saying 'Using templates will kill you'. Okay. 

Because imagine if you were to write an ad for weight loss and you open
your shiny hook templates swipe file, and you pick a hook like \"how to
do X without Y.\" (We all know that hook). 

and you write: \"How to lose five kilograms without doing any sports.\"

It flops, zero sales, right? Do you now understand why? Look, before we
go any deeper, let me actually explain some things.

Most of us will not be playing in levels one or two sophistication
levels. The smart ones will also not be playing in level five. Okay.

I\'m going to explain why. Let me actually try to explain this in the
best way I can.

**Level 1**

Is a new market? So, for example, and hopefully, you\'re going to be
watching this video before Elon Musk takes us to Mars. But the moment he
can offer that possibility for you, new market. Okay, it\'s a new
market. So, in that case, all he needs to do is just to make the claim.
He just has to say, \"Hey, come to Mars.\" That\'s it.

**Level 2** 

Is when Jeff Bezos also catches up and offers you to go to Mars. Right?
And then all he has to do is make a bigger claim, make it faster, make
it more convenient, make it something bigger, something better than Elon
Musk did. That\'s all he has to do.

**Level 5** 

Is, for example, think about weight loss. Think about... Even
copywriting, could potentially be at level 5. So think about it this
way. If I play at level 5, and I sold this course to you at level 5 -
Copywriting, whatever, right? Then it would be almost impossible to
compete with big copywriters who are very well-known in the market.

So the reason I don\'t like playing in level 5 is - **Level 5 can come
as the backend**. 

Find an audience to sell to at levels 3 and 4... I understand that this
is a bit vague. Try to stay with me. Okay? Find an audience that you can
sell to at levels three and four.

And then even if your main product is at level 5, your main product,
which is at level 5, you\'ll be selling in the backend. Why? Because
you\'ve already built trust, you\'ve become the brand. 

Okay, you become like Coca-Cola or Apple. They don\'t care it\'s
sophistication level 5. They don\'t care.

(The phone market could potentially be at sophistication level 5. I
don\'t know, probably not). 

But the big brands don\'t care because *you buy from the brand*. You
have the trust, you have all the elements to buy. And that\'s why I
suggest we do with everything we sell. Don\'t compete on level 5,
compete on level 3 and 4. 

The reason we\'re not competing on levels 1 and 2 is what I just said,
right? Level 5 is just too difficult to compete in, so it\'s better if
you don\'t compete on level 5. If people buy at level 5 - They already
know you. We\'ll be playing at levels 3 and 4, and the key to those
levels, if you don\'t know this already, is the mechanism. 

**The mechanism is the \"how\" behind the result**. I\'m going to show
you a specific example, don\'t you worry.

So let\'s use the same example again. Now remember, level three is
"introducing a mechanism", and level four is "expanding on the
mechanism". 

Look at those two examples again. 

**Level three:** "New capsule allows you to lose five kilograms within
seven days, even if you keep eating pizza and burgers". Yeah, 'new
capsule' is the mechanism. It\'s the \"how\" behind the promise to lose
five kilograms.

**Level four:** "New capsule that deconstructs fat cells DNA allows you
to lose five kilograms within seven days, even if you keep eating pizza
and burgers". 

So you see the difference between level 3 and level 4 is simply
expanding upon the mechanism. So 'new capsule' becomes 'new capsule that
does X. 

You need to give a deeper logical explanation for why it works. If you
understand this, you\'re going to understand everything. You can
literally look at competitors, actually. Let\'s see if it\'s here. (It's
not here)

You can actually look at competitors, which I\'ll show you soon, and
just by looking at those two levels, you can determine the
sophistication level of the market just like this.

So before I show you the more advanced stuff, I need to make sure that
you understand the difference between awareness and sophistication
levels. Because if you confuse the two, that\'s no good. So stay with me
for the next module.

**Module 6. Identifying the levels**

Hello and welcome to Module 6, Identifying Awareness and Sophistication
Levels.

Look. **Sophistication levels do not equal to awareness levels**.
They\'re not the same. 

High sophistication does not necessarily mean a high awareness level,
and vice versa. High awareness level does not necessarily mean a high
sophistication level. Let me show you an example.

Let\'s imagine selling a dog training course. Sophistication level -
here\'s how we know this - can be determined by asking two questions: 

-   "How many ads did my audience already see?"

-   And "How high is their skepticism?" 

So. For dog training, the sophistication level is at level 3 or 4,
depending on the demographic, okay.

Does that necessarily mean that awareness level is also level 3 or 4?
Let\'s look at the levels: *unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware,
product-aware, most aware*. So is all the market solution-aware and
product-aware? No. Right?

The answer is no, it\'s confusing because they both have 5 levels, but
**sophistication level is a constant**. It does not change. Well,
that\'s not entirely true because think about it; 

Let\'s take weight loss as an example, right? 

Some people who have not been in the market... Started gaining weight
and became a part of the market. So it is possible that they started at
a lower sophistication level than most of the market. 

But they\'ll catch up quickly just because they\'ll get bombarded with
so many ads so quickly, that we can assume it\'s a constant. That\'s the
best way to look at it if you ask me.

Sophistication levels don\'t change, that\'s the working thesis. That\'s
what we\'re going to assume when we\'re working, okay?

So, you identify it once for a specific market, and that\'s it.

But **awareness levels are person-specific**. Each person will have a
different awareness level in any market for any product.

So you'll have people at every single one of these three awareness
levels: unaware, problem-aware, and solution-aware.

Here\'s how we identify the levels:

**For sophistication levels:**

The easiest way, and I\'m not saying that everybody should do this, but
it\'s how I do it, okay? The easiest way, (except for using your logic
because think about it, your logic can get you far here).

The easiest way is by looking at competitors who are selling. Now,
hopefully, you\'ve got your access to the community with this course, so
you will be able to work on finding competitors. Seeing how to know
whether they\'re selling or not. 

But just as a general idea, if you can look at competitors who are
selling ARE selling, that\'s important because if they\'re not, we won't
get any information.

Just ask three questions:

1.  Do they have a mechanism? 

2.  How strong is the mechanism? 

3.  And do they elaborate on the mechanism?

Look at three to five competitors who are SELLING, and you\'ll
immediately see a pattern. 

A mechanism is the key to identifying sophistication levels. If they
have a mechanism, it\'s level 3. 

If they have a mechanism that they elaborate upon, it\'s level 4. It's
that easy.

Let me give you an example off the top of my head.

I was doing market research for a friend in the spirituality niche. I
found like 10 competitors just because it was super easy. There are a
ton of funnels out there selling that, and every single one of those 10
used an indirect lead, a story lead. They all told some kind of story or
whatever.

So you immediately understand that if they\'re selling indirectly, the
sophistication level is 5. 

That\'s irrelevant because I don\'t suggest that we sell in those
niches, okay? We can discuss that in the community. There are ways to
sell in those niches. I just don\'t suggest that you try to target level
5. Instead, take a piece out of that sophistication level.

So let me give you an example. If I were selling copywriting, and let\'s
say copywriting is level 5 sophistication, let\'s just imagine... 

Instead of selling copywriting, what I could do is take a piece out of
copywriting (Market research, editing, swipe file, Chat GPT) - A slice
out of this big concept.

And then when you sell "Write copy with Chat GPT", (at least at the time
of recording this video, that\'s a sophistication level 3 or 4. It\'s
not at 5.) And then when the person has bought that, **I get a chance to
build trust with them.** 

I get the chance to show my expertise. They get a chance to connect to
me personally, maybe even emotionally, getting my email, seeing my
product, seeing my videos, just like you\'re watching now. 

And then I can potentially sell to that person the sophistication level
5 product, which is copywriting, without having to compete. But that\'s,
again, a topic for a different course.

Let\'s move on. So this is the way you determine sophistication levels.
Look at competitors, three to five competitors, and you\'ll immediately
notice a pattern. It\'s either level 3 or 4. That\'s what we want to
target.

Now.

**How to determine awareness levels:** 

This is a bit more tricky because it\'s not a constant, unlike
sophistication levels, which are a constant. It\'s always the same
sophistication level, unless the market moves or whatever, okay? Every
market has all levels of awareness.

*You can decide which awareness level you\'ll be targeting*, and this is
where the game begins. Remember, solution aware is easier to sell to. If
you remember, we have unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware.

The closer you are to solution aware, and the further you are from
unaware, it\'s easier to sell to. 

But unaware is a bigger audience, which is more difficult to sell to, if
you remember the equation I showed you in one of the first videos.

And problem-aware sits straight in the middle. So now, think of your
market. Does it have a lot of problem-aware people? If so, then you can
start there, or you can jump straight to solution-aware. And once you
can convert those, start targeting problem-aware to scale. And only then
target unaware.

Let me give you a quick example. We did this with one funnel. I\'m not
going to tell you what niche it was. I signed a pretty crazy NDA. 

But essentially, what was happening in that market is everyone was
targeting unaware and problem-aware. We found a loophole, like other
marketers are educating the market to go from unaware to problem-aware,
and they were spending a ton of money. 

So we said, okay, let\'s just target solution-aware people because there
are a lot of those, thanks to other marketers. 

And then let\'s just reap the fruits, okay? Have the fruits fall into
our laps. It works. so this is how you scale businesses. This is how you
outcompete your competitors. 

They're probably targeting a specific awareness levels, not all of them.

You can target broader to scale further. 

You can target narrower, meaning solution aware, to get more conversions
at first, maybe to get some cash flowing or scale, maybe to get some
proof of concept... Whatever it is that your goal is. 

If you understand how to play with those based on what I just told you,
you can outsell your competition with other elements, obviously.

So here\'s a quick note for you, *people who are confident in their copy
skills. A lot of times, go straight to unaware* because that\'s where
the biggest scale is. 

If you remember, the closer to unaware, the bigger the audience, but the
higher the difficulty is, though. I\'ll show you an example in the next
module, but before I do, let me tell you one last thing.

Most of the funnels that we ever ran on Facebook ads, (and we ran a nice
amount of them), were to unaware because we were so confident in our
copy skills when launching that we understood that we could literally
just convert unaware. It\'s the biggest scale. 

We don\'t need to readjust the ads, the funnel, or the product, you
know? We just went straight to unaware, and we were able to scale. 

Do I suggest you do that? Yes, if you have very high confidence in your
copy. But if you don\'t, and you\'ve never done this, don\'t start
there. *It\'s usually more difficult to convert, and it\'s just going to
crash your confidence*. Ok? Stay with me for the next module for a
specific example.

**Module 7. The awareness level funnel**

ello and welcome to module 7, the awareness level funnel. This is where
hopefully everything comes together for you.

And you can use the same kind of funnel. It\'s really a magical funnel,
let\'s go with it that way.

So, if we jump back to Facebook ads, look at this ad, what awareness
level is this ad, I\'m actually going to give you a second. Quick tip,
just look at the first line. You don\'t need to read all of it.

![null](media/image6.jpeg){width="6.268055555555556in"
height="8.875694444444445in"}

\"Nine ways to make money as a professional with your very own ebook.\"

Unaware, right? And then there\'s a video.

The only thing, just like I said, you need to know is to look at the
first sentence, Unaware.

Let\'s go through the details. Jim, that\'s the guy (and you probably
know him from ClickFunnels). He\'s selling an info product on how to
write and publish your own ebook in as little as seven days. 

And if you go to his sales page just from clicking on that ad, you\'ll
see that this is the hook.

\"How to write, publish, and sell your own outrageously profitable ebook
in as little as seven days, even if you can\'t write, can\'t type, and
failed high school English class.\"

What awareness level is this hook? I\'ll give you a second. Pause this
video to check yourself. To check how good of a teacher I was if you
don\'t know this, I suck.

Okay. It\'s solution aware.

Now, if you said problem aware, I know what threw you off. 

The \"even if you can\'t write, can\'t type, and failed high school
English class\" sentence. Let me show you that again. "Even if you
can\'t write, can\'t type, and failed high school English class" that\'s
just objection handling. *It\'s not THE problem*. So don\'t confuse the
two.

Okay, anyway, let\'s look at the ad again. \"Nine ways to make money as
a professional with your very own ebook. No matter what you sell or who
you sell it to, you can sell it better with a book. Get yours now, and
you can have your own ebook ready this time next week,\" okay.

He\'s targeting an unaware audience, and in the video itself, Jim
explains the nine ways to make more money by creating your own ebook. 

So what happens to the awareness level of the unaware audience who
watches this ad? They become problem-aware, okay, because he tells you
"you could make more money if you had your own ebook. Here are now nine
ways you could make money", and you\'re like, \"Oh, well, yeah, I want
to make money with an ebook.\" Boom, you have a problem, right? Because
now you need to write that ebook.

And then he says he can teach you how to write that ebook in seven days
or less, in that video. 

So what happens to the awareness level? It becomes solution-aware. So he
took you from completely unaware; you didn\'t even know why you need an
ebook or that you need one, to the point where you\'re solution-aware. 

You not only know that you need an ebook, but you also understand that
you have a problem now that you cannot write it, and he tells you, \"I
have a solution\".

And then he sends the traffic to a solution-aware sales page. Same one.
Will say it again: \"How to write, publish, and sell your own
outrageously profitable ebook in seven days, even if you can\'t write,
can\'t type, and failed high school English class,\" solution-aware.

But that\'s not all. Because Jim is running one more ad, and I call this
the magic funnel because from what I\'ve seen, and I\'ve been tracking
Jim\'s funnel for months now. (this specific funnel; he has other
funnels). 

He didn\'t change any of the ads. He only has two ads, only two. And
that\'s the second one.

I\'m going to read it out loud quickly.

\"Finally, set yourself apart in your industry with your own book in
just seven days.\"

What awareness level is this? I\'m gonna wait.

It\'s a problem-aware ad that quickly turns into a solution-aware one.
Let me show you how:

\"Finally, set yourself apart in your industry with your own book in
just seven days.

Not only have I successfully been able to do just this for myself, but
I\'ve been able to help thousands of others to set themselves apart from
their competition in a variety of industries by showing them how to
write and publish their own eBook in just 7 days.

No longer does it need to take weeks, months or years to drag out all
the content needed to create your own book. And gone are the days when
you needed to rely on a publishing company to consider you \"worthy
enough\" to publish your book.

With the 7 Day eBook system, this can all be accomplished quickly,
simply, and not only set you apart from the rest of your industry, but
potentially create an additional income stream for yourself!

Get your copy now and have very own book written in published by this
time next week!"

*It's a problem aware ad that quickly turns into solution aware.*

And to which sales stage does Jim send the users? To the same sales
page, the solution-aware sales page that we saw before. 

I\'m going to show you this again in a second, but there\'s more.

What happens when a user has watched the first unaware ad? (Remember
it\'s a video) Their awareness level goes up to problem-aware, and then
solution-aware. And then, Jim probably, (and I don\'t know this for
sure, but I\'m guessing he understands what I understand at least). He
probably retargets those people with the problem-aware ad to
solution-aware. 

So essentially, what Jim is doing, is **he\'s catching all three
awareness levels with just two ads** in a magical funnel.

Ascending them from unaware to solution-aware inside Facebook, to then
product awareness to solution-aware on the sales page. This is the magic
funnel, and I truly believe that if you understand what Jim did here
because think about it. Let me show you the first ad again. Look at
this. This is such an unaware and attractive ad...

Potentially, every single person who is looking to make money in this
world would want to watch this video. So, *this is* *like the
collector*. This is like the beginning of the funnel, the top of the
funnel. This is the collector. It collects like everything, magnets
everything into the sphere of his funnel, and then he just retargets
them with this ad and sends them straight to his last page.

Now, if you have any questions, ask me in the copy-thinking community.
We\'re going to dive deeper into that. We\'re going to work with you on
your stuff. 

But we thought that this is where the course is going to end. I have
some more goodies for you, have some bonuses. I want to show you how to
take the information that you just learned, and hopefully, you will
start practicing this. 

You will start going to Facebook ads library and other tools to use.
Start looking at content that you see on Twitter, emails that you read,
and you\'re going to start asking yourself.

"What\'s the sophistication level? What\'s the awareness level? Why did
he decide to do that? Okay, what would happen if I did this? What would
happen if I took a problem-aware thread on Twitter and framed it as an
unaware? Would the scale go up? But what would happen to the sales if
he\'s trying to sell through the thread?"

Suddenly... What would happen is you will start seeing the Matrix. Every
piece of content, every word on the internet written or spoken becomes a
part of those shelves that you just built in your head (hopefully, with
this course). 

You can literally look at anything, and you can see inside the soul of
the business of the person who wrote it literally. This is the tool that
I cannot stress this enough. It\'s a tool that will set you apart from
literally everyone else, and most people don\'t even know that this
exists. 

You need to understand this, even experienced copywriters, many of them,
don\'t even know what you mean when you say 'awareness or sophistication
levels', which is also, by the way, a great warning for you. 

*If you\'re going to contact some companies, some people to work with,
don\'t use sophistication level and awareness levels*. Don\'t use those
words because, usually, especially if you\'re targeting traditional VP
marketing people, like startups and SaaS whatever, they have no idea
what you mean, and it\'s going to get lost in translation.

But I hope this has been good for you. You\'re going to get a couple of
what I think would be really cool bonuses to actually give you a sort of
magnifying glass to show you specifically how to use this, and again,
any questions, any comments, anything. I\'ll see you in the community.
Bye-bye, and thank you for watching.
