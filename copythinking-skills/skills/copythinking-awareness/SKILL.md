# Copythinking: Awareness & Positioning

## Overview

This is the **strategic foundation** of copywriting. Before you write a single word of copy, you need to know:

1. **WHERE** is your audience on the awareness spectrum?
2. **HOW** should you position your product?

Get this wrong → your copy fails, no matter how well-written.

## When to Use This Skill

**Load this skill FIRST when:**
- Starting any new copywriting project
- User asks about target audience or customer stage
- Planning campaigns or launches
- User says "who should I write for?" or "how do I position this?"
- Before creating sales pages, landing pages, ads, emails

**Don't use for:**
- Writing mechanics (that's copythinking-fundamentals)
- Templates/frameworks (that's copythinking-tactical)
- Already know awareness level & positioning (skip to execution skills)

## The Two References

### 1. awareness-levels.md
**The 5 awareness stages and how to write for each**

Load when:
- User doesn't know their audience's awareness stage
- Need to determine messaging approach (direct vs indirect)
- Planning which hooks/angles to use
- Need examples of copy for different awareness levels

**Quick overview:**
- **Unaware** → Symptoms, no problem yet (indirect, curiosity-driven)
- **Problem-aware** → Know problem, not solution (educate on solutions)
- **Solution-aware** → Know solutions exist (differentiate yours)
- **Product-aware** → Know your product (overcome objections)
- **Most-aware** → Ready to buy (make offer easy)

### 2. positioning-strategies.md
**How to position your product strategically**

Load when:
- Need to differentiate from competitors
- User asks "how do I make my product stand out?"
- Working on unique selling proposition (USP)
- Need positioning frameworks (painkiller vs prevention, improvement vs new opportunity)

**Quick overview:**
- Position through yourself, market, or competition
- Painkiller vs Prevention (always aim for painkiller)
- Improvement vs New Opportunity (10x better = new opportunity)
- The Positioning Chart framework

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Awareness Level
**Ask user (or infer from context):**

"Let's figure out where your audience is. Do they...
- Not know they have a problem? → **Unaware**
- Know the problem but not solutions? → **Problem-aware**  
- Know solutions exist but not yours? → **Solution-aware**
- Know your product but haven't bought? → **Product-aware**
- Ready to buy, just need final push? → **Most-aware**"

**Then read:** `references/awareness-levels.md` for detailed strategy

### Step 2: Choose Positioning Strategy
**Ask user:**

"How should we position your product?
- What makes it different?
- Painkiller (solves existing pain) or Prevention (avoids future pain)?
- Improvement on existing solutions or New Opportunity (10x better)?"

**Then read:** `references/positioning-strategies.md` for frameworks

### Step 3: Output Strategy Brief
**Synthesize findings into:**

```
AWARENESS LEVEL: [Level]
POSITIONING: [Strategy]
MESSAGING APPROACH: [Direct/Indirect]
KEY ANGLES: [Top 3-5 hooks/approaches]
NEXT STEPS: [Which copythinking skill to load next]
```

## Decision Tree

```
User asks about copywriting
│
├─ "Who should I target?" 
│  └─ Read awareness-levels.md → Determine stage
│
├─ "How do I position this?"
│  └─ Read positioning-strategies.md → Choose strategy
│
├─ "Write me copy for..."
│  └─ Do BOTH steps above first
│
└─ Already knows awareness + positioning
   └─ Skip to copythinking-fundamentals or copythinking-tactical
```

## Integration with Other Skills

**After using this skill, typically load:**
- **copythinking-fundamentals** → For writing principles
- **copythinking-persuasion** → For psychological triggers
- **copythinking-tactical** → For templates and execution

**This skill feeds into:** All other copythinking skills (it's the foundation)

## Quick Reference Card

| Awareness Level | Audience Size | Conversion Ease | Approach |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|----------|
| Unaware | Huge | Hardest | Very Indirect |
| Problem-aware | Large | Hard | Indirect |
| Solution-aware | Medium | Medium | Direct |
| Product-aware | Small | Easy | Very Direct |
| Most-aware | Tiny | Easiest | Ultra Direct |

**Remember:** Bigger audience = harder to convert (trade-off)

## Output Format (ADHD-Friendly)

When delivering strategy, use:
- ✅ Bold key points
- ✅ Bullet lists (not walls of text)
- ✅ Clear section headers
- ✅ Numbered steps for workflows
- ✅ Examples over abstract theory
- ❌ No long paragraphs without structure

## Notes

- This is Module 1 from George Ten's Copythinking methodology
- Always determine awareness BEFORE positioning
- When in doubt, aim for solution-aware (good balance of audience size & conversion)
- Most markets have audiences at multiple awareness levels - you can create different campaigns for each
