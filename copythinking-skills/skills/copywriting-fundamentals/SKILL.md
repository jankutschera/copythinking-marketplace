# Copywriting Fundamentals

Foundation principles for writing copy that converts. This skill focuses on clarity, reader connection, and the non-negotiable basics that make copy effective.

## When to use this skill

Trigger on queries about:
- Basic copywriting principles or improvements
- "My copy isn't converting" 
- "How to write better copy?"
- Clarity and readability issues
- Connecting with target audience
- Avatar/persona creation
- Benefits vs features
- Trust building in copy

## Core Components

### The 7 Golden Rules
Every piece of copy must follow these non-negotiable principles:
1. **WIIFM** - What's In It For Me (the reader)
2. **Clarity** - 6th grade reading level or below
3. **Specificity** - Exact numbers and outcomes
4. **Curiosity** - Knowledge gaps that compel reading
5. **Awareness Level** - Match reader's current state
6. **Be a Buddy** - Conversational, not professorial
7. **Rule of One** - Single focus throughout

### Fundamental Principles
- Problem → Solution framework
- Dream outcome visualization
- Emotional selling before logic
- Benefits over features
- Trust building methods
- Active voice usage

## Quick Diagnostics

Ask these questions to identify issues:
- "Can a 6th grader understand this?" → No? Check clarity
- "What's in it for the reader?" → Unclear? Apply WIIFM
- "Who exactly is this for?" → Vague? Create avatar
- "What emotion drives this?" → None? Add emotional angle

## Reference Files

Load these based on the specific need:

### For complete beginners or review
- `references/seven-golden-rules.md` - Start here for fundamentals
- `references/fundamental-principles.md` - Core psychology and frameworks

### For specific issues
- `references/editing-clarity.md` - When copy is unclear or complex
- `references/avatar-writing.md` - When missing reader connection

## Workflow Examples

### New Copy Creation
1. Load `avatar-writing.md` → Define target reader
2. Load `fundamental-principles.md` → Choose emotional angle
3. Load `seven-golden-rules.md` → Apply all 7 rules
4. Load `editing-clarity.md` → Polish for clarity

### Copy Not Converting
1. Load `seven-golden-rules.md` → Identify broken rules
2. Fix biggest issue first (usually WIIFM or specificity)
3. Load relevant reference for deeper fixes

### Quick Copy Review
Check against the 7 rules:
```
✓/✗ WIIFM clear
✓/✗ 6th grade level
✓/✗ Specific claims
✓/✗ Curiosity elements
✓/✗ Awareness match
✓/✗ Conversational tone
✓/✗ Single focus
```

## Integration Notes

**Before this skill:** Use `awareness-positioning` skill to understand market position

**After this skill:** Apply `persuasion-psychology` for emotional triggers or `tactical-copywriting` for headlines/bullets

## Key Reminders

- **Clarity beats cleverness** - Always choose simple over complex
- **Write to ONE person** - Not a demographic, a specific individual
- **Benefits sell, features tell** - Convert every feature to reader benefit
- **Confused readers don't buy** - If unclear, rewrite simpler
