# Writing to Your Avatar

## What Is an Avatar?

Your avatar is ONE specific person you're writing to - not a demographic, not a segment, but ONE real person (even if imaginary).

## Creating Your Avatar

### Step 1: Basic Demographics
- **Name:** Give them a real name (e.g., "Sarah", not "Woman 25-35")
- **Age:** Specific number (e.g., 34, not "30-40")
- **Location:** Actual place (e.g., "Austin suburbs", not "urban")
- **Family:** Specific situation (e.g., "divorced, 2 kids every other weekend")
- **Job:** Exact role (e.g., "Senior accountant at mid-size firm")
- **Income:** Specific number (e.g., "$67,000/year")

### Step 2: Day-in-the-Life

**Morning:**
- What time do they wake up?
- First thought?
- Morning routine?
- Breakfast habits?

**Workday:**
- Commute experience?
- Work environment?
- Lunch habits?
- Afternoon energy?

**Evening:**
- Dinner situation?
- Evening activities?
- Bedtime routine?
- Last thoughts?

### Step 3: Internal World

**Fears (Top 3):**
1. Immediate fear (this week)
2. Medium fear (this year)
3. Long-term fear (life)

3. Ultimate desire (life goal)

**Frustrations:**

### Step 4: Problem Relationship

**How they see their problem:**
- What they call it
- How they describe it
- When it hurts most
- What triggers it

**What they've tried:**
- Past solutions
- Why they failed
- Money spent
- Time wasted

**Their objections:**
- Why they resist help

## Writing TO Your Avatar

### The Mental Shift

**Stop writing AT people:**
"Our product helps customers achieve success"

**Start writing TO your avatar:**
"Sarah, remember last Tuesday when your boss dismissed your idea again?"

### The Avatar Conversation Method

Imagine your avatar sitting across from you at a coffee shop.

**Questions to guide your writing:**
1. What would I say first?
2. What story would resonate?
3. What would make them lean in?
4. What would make them nod?
5. What would they object to?
6. How would I respond?

### Avatar-Specific Elements

**Opening Lines:**
- Reference their specific situation
- Use their exact words
- Mirror their emotional state
- Acknowledge their reality

**Example Generic:** "Tired of being overweight?"
**Example Avatar-Specific:** "Sarah, still avoiding the break room because of what happened last month?"

**Body Copy:**
- Address their specific objections
- Use their examples
- Reference their tried solutions
- Speak to their exact situation

**Calls to Action:**

- Promise their specific outcome
- Use their decision triggers

## Avatar Empathy Building

## Using Multiple Avatars

### When You Have Different Segments:
1. Create separate avatar for each
2. Write separate copy for each
3. Never mix messages
4. Test which converts best

- 20% acknowledges others exist
- Never sacrifice clarity for inclusion

## Avatar Copy Checklist

Before Writing:
□ Avatar fully detailed
□ Problems clearly defined
□ Language documented
□ Emotions understood

During Writing:
□ Writing TO them, not AT them
□ Using their exact words
□ Addressing specific situation
□ Mirroring emotional state

After Writing:
□ Would avatar recognize themselves?
□ Does it feel personal to them?
□ Are their objections addressed?
□ Is it in their language?

## The Ultimate Avatar Test

Read your copy and ask:
"Would my avatar think I'm reading their diary?"

If yes, you've succeeded.
If no, get more specific.
