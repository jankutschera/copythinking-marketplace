# The 7 Golden Copywriting Rules

## Rule 1: WIIFM (What's In It For Me?)

Nobody cares about you. Or me. The only thing people care about is themselves.

**Example of doing it wrong:**
"This is where I shine. The basics. Let's get into it."

**Example of doing it right:**
"This is where I shine. The basics. And you will too after you read AND implement those."

### How to Apply WIIFM:
- Start every section with reader benefit
- Convert every feature to "which means you..."
- Ask "So what?" after every statement
- If no clear benefit for reader, delete it

## Rule 2: Clarity

Confusion = copywriter's death.

### The 3-Step Clarity Process:
1. **Read out loud** - If you stumble, rewrite it
2. **Hunt big words** - Replace with simple alternatives
3. **Check grade level** - Use Hemingway App, aim for 6th grade or below

**Wrong:** "Utilize our innovative solution"
**Right:** "Use our new tool"

## Rule 3: Specificity

Vague claims are worthless. Specific claims sell.

**Vague (Bad):**
"Learn how to make hundreds of dollars in no-time with nothing but your smartphone"

**Specific (Good):**
"Learn how to make $2,450 by the end of this week by writing simple tweets on your smartphone"

### Specificity Checklist:
- Exact numbers, not ranges
- Specific timeframes
- Named solutions
- Clear outcomes
- Concrete examples

## Rule 4: Curiosity

Create knowledge gaps that readers must fill.

**No Curiosity:**
"Learn how to make money by becoming a ghostwriter on Twitter"

**With Curiosity:**
"Learn how to make $2,450 by the end of this week by writing simple sentences using nothing more than your smartphone"

### Curiosity Techniques:
- Hide the "how"
- Tease the outcome
- Create open loops
- Use "secret/hidden/little-known"

## Rule 5: Awareness Level Alignment

Write to where your reader IS, not where you want them to be.

### The Awareness Check:
- **Unaware?** Use curiosity, secrets, tips
- **Problem-Aware?** Agitate problem, show empathy  
- **Solution-Aware?** Compare solutions, show superiority

Test awareness by monitoring engagement. Low engagement = wrong awareness level.

## Rule 6: Be a Buddy

Write like you're talking to a friend at a bar, not presenting to a board.

### Buddy Writing Techniques:
- Use "you" constantly
- Ask questions (Right?)
- Use conversational transitions (Now, So, But)
- Write to ONE person
- Use contractions (don't vs do not)
- Add personality markers

**Professor Style (Bad):**
"One must consider the implications"

**Buddy Style (Good):**
"Think about what this means for you"

## Rule 7: The Rule of One

One reader. One problem. One solution. One emotion. One CTA.

### Rule of One Checklist:
- ONE big idea per piece
- ONE core emotion driving it
- ONE primary benefit
- ONE clear next step
- ONE target reader

**Breaking Rule of One:**
"Get our course! Plus coaching! And templates! For beginners and experts!"

**Following Rule of One:**
"Get the course that takes beginners from zero to first client"
