## Core Workflow

### 1. Market Research Phase

**Start here for any new project:**

1. **Identify market sophistication** (references/sophistication-levels.md)
   - Analyze 3-5 successful competitors
   - Look for mechanisms in their copy
   - Determine level 1-5

2. **Choose your sub-market** (references/market-manipulation.md)
   - Map all possible markets for your product
   - Apply the 4-element filter:
     - Biggest market
     - Least competition
     - Biggest problem
     - Most urgent problem

3. **Deep customer research** (references/reddit-research.md)
   - Mine Reddit for language patterns
   - Find stories and pain points
   - Document actual customer words

### 2. Strategy Development Phase

1. **Develop your Big Idea** (references/big-idea.md)
   - Test against 4 criteria:
     - Is it NEW?
     - Is it BIG or FAST?
     - Is it EXCITING?
     - Does it address main pain/desire?

2. **Apply framing strategies** (references/framing-reality.md)
   - Decide what to highlight vs hide
   - Frame features as benefits
   - Bend reality without lying

3. **Implement Rule of One** (references/rule-of-one.md)
   - One big idea
   - One emotion
   - One benefit
   - One outcome

## Advanced Techniques Quick Reference

### Sophistication Level Response

| Level | Market State | Your Approach |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| 1 | Birth of market | Make ANY claim |
| 2 | Competition arrives | Make BIGGER claim |
| 3 | Claims saturated | Introduce MECHANISM |
| 4 | Mechanisms saturated | BETTER mechanism |
| 5 | Maximum skepticism | Indirect approach/story |

**Key insight**: Most profitable markets are at levels 3-4. Avoid level 5 for direct response.

### Big Idea Checklist

Before proceeding with any copy, validate your Big Idea:

- [ ] **NEW**: Has anyone else used this angle?
- [ ] **BIG/FAST**: Is the promise substantial and quick?
- [ ] **EXCITING**: Does it create anticipation?
- [ ] **RELEVANT**: Does it hit the main pain/desire?

If missing any element, revisit market research.

### Reddit Research Framework

1. **Find the right subreddit** for your market
2. **Sort by Top** (this week/month/year)
3. **Look for**:
   - Exact language they use
   - Repeated pain points
   - Success stories
   - Common objections
4. **Document**:
   - Specific phrases (copy verbatim)
   - Emotional triggers
   - Story patterns

## Integration with Other Skills

This skill provides the research foundation for:

1. **awareness-positioning**: Sophistication informs awareness strategy
2. **persuasion-psychology**: Big Ideas drive psychological triggers
3. **tactical-copywriting**: Research provides language for hooks/bullets
4. **copywriting-fundamentals**: Customer language improves clarity

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping sophistication analysis** - Never assume; always verify with competitor research
2. **Choosing level 5 markets** - Unless you have massive brand trust, avoid maximum skepticism
3. **Generic Big Ideas** - If it's not NEW, it's not big enough
4. **Ignoring actual customer language** - Your words < their words
5. **Breaking Rule of One** - Confusion kills conversion

## Quick Start Templates

### Sophistication Analysis Template

```
Competitor 1: [Name]
- Mechanism present? [Y/N]
- Mechanism elaborated? [Y/N]
- Story-led? [Y/N]

Competitor 2: [Name]
[Same analysis]

Pattern identified: Level [X]
Strategy: [Based on level]
```

### Big Idea Development Template

```
Core promise: [What transformation]
Mechanism: [How it works]
Uniqueness: [What's different]

Test:
- NEW? [Explain why]
- BIG/FAST? [Specific claim]
- EXCITING? [Emotional response]
- ADDRESSES PAIN? [Which one]
```
