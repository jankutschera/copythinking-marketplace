# Customer Journey Mapping

## The Journey vs. Awareness Levels

**Awareness levels** = Where they are in understanding their problem/solution
**Customer journey** = Where they are in their life/business stage

Both matter. Together, they create a complete picture.

### Example: Business Owner Journey

**Journey stages:**
- Pre-business (thinking about starting)
- 0-1 (just started, no clients)
- 1-10 (early growth)
- 10-100 (scaling)
- 100+ (optimizing)

**Each stage can be at ANY awareness level:**
- Pre-business + Unaware = "I'm unhappy at work"
- Pre-business + Problem-aware = "I need to escape corporate"
- Pre-business + Solution-aware = "I should start a business"

## The Twitter Story: Complete Journey Example

### Stage 1: UNAWARE
- Joins Twitter randomly
- No idea about opportunities
- Just consuming content

### Stage 2: PROBLEM-AWARE
- Reads thread about making money on Twitter
- Realizes: "I have no audience"
- Problem identified, no solution yet

### Stage 3: SOLUTION-AWARE
- Gets DM: "We can grow your account"
- Discovers ghostwriting exists
- Knows solutions available

### Stage 4: PRODUCT-AWARE
- Gets specific offer: "$2,000/month"
- Second offer: "$2,000 for 3,000 followers/month"
- Comparing specific products

### Stage 5: MOST-AWARE
- Knows everything about offers
- Last question: "What's the deal?"
- Needs final push (guarantee/bonus/urgency)

## Mapping Your Customer's Journey

### The Timeline Method

Map what happens BEFORE they buy:

**-6 months:** What life event starts their journey?
**-3 months:** What makes problem urgent?
**-1 month:** What triggers solution search?
**-1 week:** What makes them compare options?
**Today:** What makes them buy NOW?

### The Trigger Method

Identify key moments that move them forward:

**Life triggers:**
- Birth/death
- Job change
- Relationship change
- Health scare
- Financial crisis

**Business triggers:**
- Revenue plateau
- Competition threat
- Regulation change
- Technology shift
- Team problems

## Journey-Based Messaging

### Messaging by Journey Stage

**Early journey (0-1):**
- Focus on possibility
- Address fear
- Show first steps
- Emphasize support

**Mid journey (1-10):**
- Focus on optimization
- Address overwhelm
- Show systems
- Emphasize efficiency

**Late journey (10+):**
- Focus on scaling
- Address complexity
- Show leverage
- Emphasize ROI

### Disqualifying Wrong Stages

**If you want experienced clients:**
- "For those already making $10k/month"
- "Not for beginners"
- "You should already have clients"

**If you want beginners:**
- "Perfect for your first..."
- "No experience needed"
- "Starting from zero"

## The Backstep Strategy

Target people ONE STEP before obvious customers:

**Obvious:** People wanting to lose weight
**Backstep:** People whose clothes don't fit

**Obvious:** People starting businesses
**Backstep:** People hating their jobs

**Obvious:** People needing copywriting
**Backstep:** People with products not selling

Why backstep works:
- Less competition
- More urgency
- Bigger pain
- Higher prices

## Journey + Awareness Matrix

Map both dimensions for precision:

|Journey Stage|Unaware|Problem-Aware|Solution-Aware|
|-------------|--------|------------|--------------|
|Pre-business|"Unhappy at work"|"Need escape"|"Should start business"|
|0-1 Clients|"Why so hard?"|"Need clients"|"Need marketing"|
|1-10 Clients|"Overwhelmed"|"Can't scale"|"Need systems"|
|10+ Clients|"Plateau"|"Missing something"|"Need specific fix"|

## Customer Journey Triggers

### What moves them forward?

**Information triggers:**
- Success story ("He did it, so can I")
- Warning story ("This could happen to me")
- New possibility ("I didn't know this existed")

**Emotional triggers:**
- Embarrassment moment
- Inspiration moment
- Fear moment
- Anger moment

**External triggers:**
- Deadline approaching
- Opportunity arising
- Competition succeeding
- Support appearing

## Journey-Based Proof

Match proof to journey stage:

**Early stage proof:**
- "Zero to first $1k"
- "Complete beginner"
- "Never done this before"

**Mid stage proof:**
- "$5k to $50k/month"
- "Had some success"
- "Took it next level"

**Late stage proof:**
- "8-figures to 9-figures"
- "Industry leader"
- "Category creator"

## The Journey Funnel

Different content for different stages:

**Top of Journey (Early):**
- Broad education
- Inspiration/possibility
- Free/cheap
- Mass market

**Middle of Journey:**
- Specific solutions
- Tactical/practical
- Moderate price
- Qualified audience

**Bottom of Journey (Late):**
- Advanced strategies
- Personalized/custom
- Premium price
- Highly qualified

## Journey Research Questions

Ask your market:

1. "What happened right before you started looking for a solution?"
2. "How long have you been dealing with this?"
3. "What else have you tried?"
4. "What made you finally take action?"
5. "What almost stopped you?"

## Journey-Based Objections

**Early journey objections:**
- "Is this even possible?"
- "Am I capable?"
- "Is this real?"

**Mid journey objections:**
- "Will this work for my situation?"
- "Is this better than what I tried?"
- "Can I afford to switch?"

**Late journey objections:**
- "Is this worth the disruption?"
- "Will this scale?"
- "What's the ROI?"

## Creating Journey Maps

### Simple Journey Map

```
Stage: [Name]
Thoughts: What they're thinking
Feelings: What they're feeling
Actions: What they're doing
Needs: What would help most
Message: What to say to them
```

### Detailed Journey Map

```
Stage: [Name]
Demographics: Who they are
Psychographics: How they think
Behaviors: What they do
Triggers: What moves them
Obstacles: What stops them
Solutions: What they've tried
Channels: Where to find them
Message: How to speak to them

```

## Using Journey Intelligence

### For targeting:
- Choose journey stage with most urgency
- Avoid stages with no money
- Focus on stages with clear triggers

### For messaging:
- Mirror their current reality
- Speak to their specific stage
- Reference their journey explicitly

### For products:
- Create journey-specific solutions
- Price based on journey stage
- Support based on journey needs

## The Journey Truth

**Same product, different journeys = Different businesses**

Example: Copywriting course

**For beginners:** "Start your copywriting career"
**For freelancers:** "Double your rates"
**For agencies:** "Systemize your copy process"
**For businesses:** "Write your own copy"

Same skill taught. Completely different products.

## Remember

People buy based on where they are, not where you are.

Meet them at their stage.
Speak their stage language.
Solve their stage problems.
Move them to next stage.

That's journey-based marketing.
