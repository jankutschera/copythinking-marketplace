# Reddit Research Methods

## Finding Customer Language with Reddit

Reddit is a goldmine for understanding how your audience actually talks about their problems, desires, and experiences.

### Core Reddit Research Process

1. **Find the right subreddit**
   - Search for your niche/market
   - Look for active communities (10k+ members ideal)
   - Check recent activity (posts within last 24h)

2. **Sort strategically**
   - **Top → This Week/Month**: Current hot topics
   - **Top → All Time**: Evergreen pain points
   - **Controversial**: Polarizing issues (great for angles)

3. **Mine for gold**
   - Exact phrases they use (copy verbatim)
   - Emotional language patterns
   - Repeated complaints/desires
   - Success stories and transformations

### What to Document

**Language patterns:**
- How they describe their problem
- Words they use for desired outcomes
- Phrases that get upvoted
- Common metaphors/analogies

**Pain points:**
- Most upvoted complaints
- Recurring frustrations
- "I wish..." statements
- "Why is it so hard to..." posts

**Objections:**
- Skepticism about solutions
- Past failures mentioned
- Trust issues expressed
- Price sensitivity indicators

## Storytelling with Reddit Writing Prompts

**Subreddit**: r/WritingPrompts (16.8M members)

### How to steal stories effectively

1. **Go to r/WritingPrompts**
2. **Filter by Top** (This Week/Month/Year)
3. **Find prompts that spark ideas**
4. **Read top comments for execution inspiration**

### The storytelling process

1. **Find the right prompt**
   - Should immediately trigger an idea
   - Must relate to your message
   - Can be adapted to your market

2. **Adapt to your audience**
   - Take the story structure
   - Insert your market's context
   - Add relevant details
   - Keep emotional beats

3. **Create the bridge**
   - Story alone isn't enough
   - Must relate to reader's situation
   - Show the parallel to their life
   - Land on your point/lesson

### Example transformation

**Original prompt**: "A shady street vendor sells you an item..."
**Adapted for copywriting**: Story about discovering a "sketchy" copywriting technique that actually works

**Key**: The moment of realization in the story parallels the transformation you're selling.

4. **Note what gets downvoted** - Reveals market's BS detector

## Warning Signs to Avoid

- Subreddits with heavy moderation (sanitized language)
- Inactive communities (outdated problems)
- Meme-only subs (no real discussion)
- Corporate-run subs (inauthentic voice)

Remember: You're not looking for what people SHOULD say. You're looking for what they ACTUALLY say when they think no one important is listening.
