# Advanced Framing Techniques

## What is Framing?

Framing is the art of **bending reality without lying** - choosing what to emphasize, how to present it, and what context to provide.

We don't lie. We frame reality to make our product as desirable as possible.

## The Basic Framework

### Same Reality, Different Frames

**Product:** Soap that reduces acne in 30 days

**Frame options for result:**
- "Reduce the effects of acne" (medical/clinical)
- "Smoothen skin imperfections" (beauty focus)
- "Hide skin irregularities" (coverage focus)
- "Ease skin discomfort" (pain focus)
- "Restore your confidence" (emotional focus)

**Frame options for timeline:**
- "In 30 days" (specific)
- "Within a month" (flexible)
- "In 4 weeks" (weekly progress implied)
- "Before 30 days pass" (faster possible)
- "Starting from day one" (immediate start)

Same product. Same truth. Different emotional impact.

## The Three Levels of Framing

### Level 1: Word Choice
Single word substitutions that change perception

**Examples:**
- "Cost" → "Investment"
- "Buy" → "Claim"
- "Cheap" → "Affordable"
- "Problem" → "Challenge"
- "Failed" → "Learned"

### Level 2: Context Manipulation
Changing the comparison or reference point

**Examples:**
- "$97" → "Less than coffee for a month"
- "2 hours" → "One movie length"
- "50 pages" → "Weekend read"
- "6 months" → "By summer"

### Level 3: Strategic Omission
What you choose NOT to say

**Example:** FDA Approved
- **Include if:** Competitors aren't approved
- **Omit if:** Everyone is approved (makes you look dangerous)

## Advanced Framing Strategies

### The Preframe

Set expectations before revealing information:

**Without preframe:** "This course is $2,000"
**With preframe:** "Most people pay $10,000 for this level of training. You can get it for $2,000"

### The Reframe

Change meaning of existing belief:

**Current belief:** "I failed at business"
**Reframe:** "You've eliminated what doesn't work. You're closer to success than beginners"

### The Context Frame

Place information in favorable context:

**Without context:** "Takes 90 days"
**With context:** "While others take years, you'll be done in 90 days"

### The Comparison Frame

Control what they compare you to:

**Bad comparison:** You vs. cheaper competitor
**Good comparison:** You vs. doing nothing
**Better comparison:** You vs. expensive alternative

## Framing for Different Scenarios

### Framing High Price

**Don't:** "It costs $5,000"

**Do:** Frame as:
- Investment with ROI
- Fraction of value delivered
- Payment plan availability
- Cost of not buying
- Compared to alternatives

**Example:** "For less than hiring one employee for a month, get lifetime access"

### Framing Complexity

**Don't:** "It's complicated but you'll figure it out"

**Do:** Frame as:
- Step-by-step process
- Guided journey
- Progressive learning
- Supported experience

**Example:** "Master one simple technique at a time with daily guidance"

### Framing Time Investment

**Don't:** "It takes 6 months"

**Do:** Frame as:
- Faster than alternatives
- Time saved long-term
- Progressive results
- Flexible pacing

**Example:** "See initial results in weeks, mastery by month 6"

### Framing Effort Required

**Don't:** "It requires hard work"

**Do:** Frame as:
- Rewarding process
- Supported journey
- Proven system
- Minimum effective dose

**Example:** "15 minutes daily using our proven system"

## Psychological Framing Techniques

### Loss vs. Gain Framing

**Loss frame (fear):** "Stop losing $10,000 annually to poor copy"
**Gain frame (desire):** "Add $10,000 monthly with better copy"

**When to use each:**
- Loss frame: Urgent problems, risk-averse audience
- Gain frame: Growth opportunities, ambitious audience

### Status Quo vs. Change Framing

**Status quo:** "Keep doing what works, just optimize"
**Change:** "Revolutionary new approach"

**When to use each:**
- Status quo: Conservative markets, risk-averse
- Change: Frustrated markets, early adopters

### Individual vs. Group Framing

**Individual:** "You'll personally achieve..."
**Group:** "Join thousands who are..."

**When to use each:**
- Individual: Personal development, unique solutions
- Group: Social proof needed, community aspect

## The Frame Stacking Method

Layer multiple frames for maximum impact:

1. **Preframe** (set expectation)
2. **Main frame** (present information)
3. **Reframe objection** (handle resistance)
4. **Future frame** (project success)

**Example:**
1. "While others charge $10,000..." (preframe)
2. "You get everything for $997" (main frame)
3. "That's less than your monthly ad spend" (reframe)
4. "Imagine ROI in 30 days" (future frame)

## Framing Formulas

### The "Even If" Frame
"[Achieve result] even if [biggest objection]"

**Example:** "Write compelling copy even if you failed English"

### The "Without" Frame
"[Achieve result] without [expected requirement]"

**Example:** "Build a business without investors"

### The "While" Frame
"[Achieve result] while [maintaining comfort]"

**Example:** "Lose weight while eating carbs"

### The "Instead Of" Frame
"Instead of [bad alternative], [better solution]"

**Example:** "Instead of hiring expensive copywriters, write it yourself"

## Framing Objections

### Price Objection
**Reframe as:**
- Investment, not cost
- Value, not price
- ROI, not expense
- Opportunity cost of waiting

### Time Objection
**Reframe as:**
- Time saved long-term
- Compressed learning
- Flexible pacing
- Cost of delay

### Ability Objection
**Reframe as:**
- Proven system
- Support included
- Progressive difficulty
- Past success stories

### Trust Objection
**Reframe as:**
- Guarantee/risk reversal
- Social proof
- Transparency
- Shared values

## Ethical Framing Guidelines

### Always True
Every frame must be technically true

### Best Interest
Frame toward customer's genuine benefit

### Sustainable Claims
Don't frame beyond what you can deliver

### Clear Communication
Framing shouldn't obscure important information

## Master Framing Examples

### Feature → Benefit Frame

**Feature:** "PDF with 100 pages"
**Framed:** "Complete blueprint you can implement today"

**Feature:** "Email support"
**Framed:** "Direct access to expert guidance"

**Feature:** "Monthly updates"
**Framed:** "Always current with market changes"

### Weakness → Strength Frame

**Weakness:** "Small company"
**Framed:** "Boutique service with personal attention"

**Weakness:** "New product"
**Framed:** "Early adopter advantage"

**Weakness:** "High price"
**Framed:** "Premium quality for serious players"

## The Ultimate Framing Test

Ask yourself:
1. Is it true?
2. Does it serve the customer?
3. Does it differentiate us?
4. Does it reduce resistance?
5. Does it increase desire?

If all 5 = yes, your frame works.

## Remember

Framing isn't about deception. It's about:
- Choosing the most compelling truth
- Highlighting what matters most
- Providing helpful context
- Guiding toward good decisions

Master framing, and even average products become irresistible.
