# Big Idea Framework

## What is a Big Idea?

The Big Idea is **how you choose to present your product** - the angle, story, or light that makes it irresistible. It's the make-it-or-break-it element of your copy.

**Think of it like this:** 
You're inviting friends to a club. You don't pitch the same way to everyone:
- To party animals: "Hot new DJ tonight!"
- To socialites: "VIP section available"
- To budget-conscious: "$3 drinks all night"
- To comfort-seekers: "Best seating area in town"

Same club. Different Big Ideas.

## The 4 Criteria of a Big Idea

### 1. NEW

**The Lizard Brain Test**

If the prospect's brain categorizes your message as "seen this before" → They click away.

**Must be new or you're dead.**

**Ways to be "new":**
- Revealed
- Announcing  
- Discovery
- Game-changing
- Disruptive
- Breakthrough
- First time
- Secret
- Hidden

**Example transformations:**
- Old: "Lose weight fast"
- New: "Hollywood's hidden 'meal timing' secret revealed"

### 2. BIG or FAST

**The "So What?" Test**

Small, slow promises = No excitement = No sale

**Must be substantial AND/OR quick.**

**Big examples:**
- Turn $10,000 into $20,000 (Big)
- 1,000 followers (Big for beginners)
- Industry-changing (Big impact)

**Fast examples:**
- In 7 days (Fast)
- By tomorrow (Fast)
- In one conversation (Fast)

**The multiplier effect:** Big + Fast = Irresistible
- "10kg weight loss" (Big) + "in 30 days" (Fast)

### 3. EXCITING

**The "Can't Wait" Test**

Does it create anticipation? Does reading it make them want it NOW?

**Boring:** "5-hour daily training program"
**Exciting:** "15-minute morning ritual"

**Excitement killers:**
- Too much work
- Too complex
- Too long
- Too vague

**Excitement builders:**
- Easy/simple
- Fast results
- Specific outcomes
- Tangible benefits

### 4. ADDRESSES MAIN PAIN/DESIRE

**The "That's Me!" Test**

Must hit the #1 thing keeping them awake at night.

**Missing the mark:**
- Solving problem #5 on their list
- Addressing nice-to-have vs need-to-have
- Generic benefits everyone claims

**Hitting the bullseye:**
- Their exact words/complaints
- Their secret desire
- Their biggest fear
- Their immediate urgency

## Big Idea Development Process

### Step 1: List all possible angles

For your product/service, brainstorm:
- 10+ different ways to present it
- Different benefits to emphasize
- Different problems it solves
- Different mechanisms/methods

### Step 2: Test each against criteria

```
Angle: [Your angle]
□ NEW - Why: _________
□ BIG/FAST - Specifically: _________
□ EXCITING - Because: _________
□ ADDRESSES PAIN - Which one: _________

Score: __/4
```

### Step 3: Enhance failing elements

If missing NEW:
- Add unique mechanism
- Find contrarian angle
- Combine two ideas
- Challenge common belief

If missing BIG/FAST:
- Increase promise
- Shorten timeframe
- Add multiplier effect
- Stack benefits

If missing EXCITING:
- Simplify process
- Reduce effort needed
- Add emotional outcome
- Make more tangible

If missing PAIN/DESIRE:
- Research deeper
- Get more specific
- Use their exact words
- Focus on urgency

## Real Big Idea Examples

### Example 1: Video Marketing Course

**Big Idea:** "In fact, the next 15-second video of yours could bring you an endless stream of leads"

Analysis:
- ✓ NEW: "15-second video" (when everyone taught long-form)
- ✓ FAST: "15 seconds" + "next video"
- ✓ EXCITING: "endless stream of leads"
- ✓ ADDRESSES DESIRE: Lead generation

**What sold:** Instagram Reels course
**Why it worked:** Big Idea was so strong, offer details didn't matter

### Example 2: Photo Editing

**Big Idea:** "Design Instagram photos using secret free apps on iPhone without ever opening laptop"

Analysis:
- ✓ NEW: "secret free apps"
- ✓ FAST: "on iPhone" (no laptop needed)
- ✓ EXCITING: Professional results from phone
- ✓ ADDRESSES PAIN: Complicated desktop software

**Result:** $1 million in sales

### Example 3: Singing Course

**Big Idea:** "Reach 12 months of progress in 1 month without breaking your voice into registers"

Analysis:
- ✓ NEW: "without registers" (contrarian)
- ✓ FAST: "1 month vs 12 months"
- ✓ EXCITING: 12x faster progress
- ✓ ADDRESSES PAIN: Slow, frustrating progress

## Big Idea Formulas

### The Contrarian Formula
"How to [desired result] without [expected requirement]"

### The Secret Formula
"The hidden [tool/method/button] that [authority] uses to [amazing result]"

### The Discovery Formula
"[Authority] accidentally discovered how to [amazing result] in [short time]"

### The Comparison Formula
"Why [small group] gets [amazing result] while [everyone else] struggles"

## When Your Big Idea is Strong Enough

**You know it's ready when:**

1. **Offer becomes secondary** - People buy the vision, not features
2. **Instant understanding** - No explanation needed
3. **Emotional reaction** - "I NEED this"
4. **Stands alone** - Hook itself could sell

**The ultimate test:** If you only had one sentence to make the sale, would your Big Idea do it?

## Common Big Idea Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Feature as Big Idea
Wrong: "Course with 50 video lessons"
Right: "Master copywriting in weekend bootcamp"

### Mistake 2: Too Many Ideas
Wrong: "Lose weight, gain muscle, boost energy, and sleep better"
Right: Pick ONE transformation

### Mistake 3: Me-Too Positioning
Wrong: "Another Facebook ads course"
Right: "The $5/day Facebook strategy"

### Mistake 4: Inside-Out Thinking
Wrong: What you think is cool
Right: What THEY desperately want

## Big Idea Hierarchy

**God Tier:** All 4 criteria strongly met
- Sell anything
- Price irrelevant
- Competition irrelevant

**A Tier:** 3 criteria strongly met
- Very sellable
- Some price sensitivity
- Need good copy

**B Tier:** 2 criteria met
- Harder sell
- Price matters
- Need great copy + proof

**Unsellable:** 0-1 criteria met
- Don't bother
- Find new angle
- Or new product

## Quick Big Idea Audit

Before writing any copy, ask:

1. Can I explain it in one sentence?
2. Would my mom get excited?
3. Is anyone else saying this?
4. Would I buy it immediately?
5. Does it sound too good to be true (in a good way)?

If any answer is "no" - keep developing.

## Final Truth

**Market → Offer → Copy**

But with a strong enough Big Idea:

**Big Idea → Everything else**

The Big Idea is so powerful that when you nail it, even bad copy can sell. When you miss it, even world-class copy fails.

Spend 80% of your time on the Big Idea. Write copy with the remaining 20%.
