# Hook Creator

## Overview

Generate 10 compelling hook options for any marketing content using proven copywriting frameworks. Each hook is labeled with its framework and optimized for platform compatibility.

## Workflow

When a user requests hooks, follow this process:

### Step 1: Gather Required Inputs

Ask for these four parameters if not already provided:

1. **Content type** - What format (email subject line, social media post, ad headline, landing page, video title, etc.)
2. **Target audience** - Who will see this content (demographics, psychographics, pain points)
3. **Main benefit or promise** - What specific value or transformation the content delivers
4. **Tone** - Desired voice (professional, casual, urgent, playful, authoritative, etc.)

### Step 2: Generate 10 Hook Options

Create exactly 10 hooks using at least 5 different frameworks from the list below. Vary the approaches to give the user diverse options:

**Core Frameworks:**

1. **Curiosity Gap** - Create incomplete information that demands resolution. Tease valuable information without revealing the answer.

2. **Pain-Agitation-Solution** - Call out a specific pain point, amplify the consequences, then hint at the solution.

3. **Benefit-Driven** - Lead directly with clear, tangible value. Use specific outcomes, not vague promises.

4. **Contrarian** - Challenge common assumptions or conventional wisdom in your industry. Start with "Most people think... but actually..."

5. **Specific Numbers** - Use odd, precise numbers for credibility (e.g., "7 ways" not "several ways", "23 minutes" not "20 minutes").

6. **Question + Benefit** - Pose a problem question that implies the solution exists in your content.

7. **Social Proof** - Leverage popularity, authority, or testimonials. Use numbers or names when possible.

8. **Time/Urgency** - Create FOMO or leverage timely relevance. Reference deadlines, limited availability, or current events.

9. **Transformation** - Show the before → after journey. Use contrast to highlight the change.

10. **Listicle** - Numbered format promising specific takeaways. Works especially well for how-to content.

**Additional frameworks to consider:**
- **Failure/Mistake** - "The #1 mistake that's costing you..."
- **Secret/Insider** - "What [authority figure] doesn't want you to know about..."
- **Shock Value** - Bold, unexpected claims (must be truthful)
- **Identity/Belonging** - "For [specific group] who want [specific outcome]"

### Step 3: Format Each Hook

Present each hook with:
- The hook text
- Framework label in parentheses
- Keep under 100 characters when possible for platform compatibility (but allow longer if content type demands it)

Example format:
```
1. Why your best customers are the ones you're ignoring (Contrarian)
2. 7 email tactics that doubled our reply rate in 23 days (Specific Numbers + Transformation)
3. The inbox strategy that outperforms ads 3:1 (Benefit-Driven + Social Proof)
```

## Quality Guidelines

When generating hooks:

- **Be specific, not generic** - Use concrete details, numbers, and outcomes instead of vague promises
- **Match the tone** - Ensure language aligns with the specified tone and brand voice
- **Avoid empty clickbait** - Every hook must deliver on its promise
- **Test different lengths** - Include both punchy short hooks and longer descriptive ones
- **Break category norms** - Include at least 2 options that challenge industry conventions
- **Consider the platform** - Email subjects need different approach than social posts or ads
- **Use power words sparingly** - Words like "secret," "ultimate," "guaranteed" work but can seem spammy if overused

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Email Subject Lines:**
- 41-50 characters show best open rates
- Front-load value (mobile preview shows ~30 chars)
- Avoid spam triggers (ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation!!!)

**Social Media:**
- First 1-2 lines crucial (preview determines stop-scroll)
- Platform character limits vary (Twitter/X 280, LinkedIn 210 preview)
- Emoji usage depends on brand and audience

**Ad Headlines:**
- Google Ads: 30 character limit per headline
- Facebook/Meta: 40 characters before truncation
- Must work standalone without body copy context

**Landing Pages:**
- Can be longer, more descriptive (no character constraint)
- Should complement subheadline
- Include primary keyword for SEO
