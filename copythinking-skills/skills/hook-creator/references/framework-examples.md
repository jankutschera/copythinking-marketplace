# Hook Framework Examples and Patterns

This reference provides detailed patterns, formulas, and examples for each copywriting framework.

## 1. Curiosity Gap

**Pattern:** Reveal that valuable information exists without giving it away. Create a knowledge vacuum.

**Formula variants:**
- "The [surprising thing] that [impressive result]"
- "What [authority] knows about [topic] that you don't"
- "Why [counterintuitive statement]"
- "[Number] things about [topic] that will surprise you"

**Examples:**
- "The 3-word phrase that doubles response rates (and why most marketers miss it)"
- "Why your highest-performing content is probably hurting your brand"
- "What we learned spending $2M on Facebook ads that the gurus won't tell you"
- "The inbox strategy nobody's talking about (but everyone should use)"

**Tips:**
- Don't give away the answer in the hook
- Make the gap feel specific, not generic
- Ensure the content actually delivers the answer

## 2. Pain-Agitation-Solution (PAS)

**Pattern:** Identify pain → Amplify consequences → Hint at relief

**Formula variants:**
- "[Pain point]? It's costing you [specific loss]. Here's how to fix it."
- "Still [painful action]? That's why [negative outcome]."
- "The real cost of [common mistake]"

**Examples:**
- "Your email list is shrinking. Each lost subscriber is $43 in lifetime value. Here's the retention fix."
- "Still writing generic subject lines? That's why 94% of your emails go unread."
- "Hiring mistakes cost $17K per bad hire. The 3 questions that predict success."
- "Your landing page is bleeding conversions. Here's where visitors abandon (and how to fix it)."

**Tips:**
- Be specific about the pain (not vague)
- Quantify the cost when possible
- Don't make readers feel attacked—offer hope

## 3. Benefit-Driven

**Pattern:** Lead with clear, specific value. Answer "What's in it for me?" immediately.

**Formula variants:**
- "[Achieve desired outcome] in [timeframe]"
- "How to [get benefit] without [common obstacle]"
- "[Number/Percentage] increase in [metric] using [method]"
- "Get [result] even if [objection]"

**Examples:**
- "Double your email open rates in 14 days without spending on ads"
- "Generate 50+ qualified leads per month from LinkedIn (15 min/day)"
- "Cut your customer acquisition cost by 40% with this funnel tweak"
- "Build a 10K email list even if you're starting from zero"

**Tips:**
- Use numbers and specifics
- Address the main objection
- Promise outcomes, not features

## 4. Contrarian

**Pattern:** Challenge conventional wisdom or popular beliefs in your industry.

**Formula variants:**
- "Stop [common advice]. Here's what works instead."
- "Why [popular belief] is wrong about [topic]"
- "Everyone says [common wisdom]. The data shows [opposite]."
- "[Industry standard] is dead. Here's what's replacing it."

**Examples:**
- "Stop asking for the sale. This 'soft close' converts 3X better."
- "Why more traffic won't solve your revenue problem (and what will)"
- "Everyone says 'content is king.' Our data shows distribution beats creation 10:1."
- "Your 'ideal customer profile' is limiting your growth. Here's why."

**Tips:**
- Have strong evidence for contrarian claims
- Don't be contrarian just for shock value
- Offer a better alternative, not just criticism

## 5. Specific Numbers

**Pattern:** Use precise, odd numbers to increase credibility and attention.

**Formula variants:**
- "[Odd number] ways to [achieve outcome]"

- "The [specific number] [unit] blueprint for [result]"

**Tips:**

## Advanced Framework Combinations

The most powerful hooks often combine multiple frameworks:

**Examples:**
- Curiosity + Numbers: "The 3 words that tripled our conversion rate (you're probably not using them)"
- Social Proof + Benefit: "How 500+ agencies increased client retention by 40% in 90 days"
- Contrarian + Transformation: "We ignored 'best practices' and grew 10X faster. Here's what we did instead."
- PAS + Urgency: "Your content strategy is outdated. AI changed everything in January 2024. Here's the new playbook."
- Question + Social Proof: "Want the email template 2,000 SDRs use to book 30% of cold prospects?"
