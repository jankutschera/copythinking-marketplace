# AI Engine Optimization (AEO)

Analyze and optimize content to be discoverable and citable by AI-powered search engines. Unlike traditional SEO, AEO focuses on becoming the source AI models cite when answering queries.

## Required Inputs

Always collect these five inputs before starting analysis:

1. **Content piece**: URL or paste the content to analyze
2. **Primary query**: What search query should this rank for?
3. **Target audience**: Who is searching for this?
4. **Content goal**: Inform, convert, educate, compare, etc.
5. **Format**: Blog post, product page, FAQ, guide, etc.

## Analysis Process

Follow this sequence for every AEO analysis:

### 1. Initial Assessment

Evaluate four dimensions:
- **Structure**: Headings, lists, Q&A pairs, table of contents
- **Clarity**: Answer prominence, directness, specificity
- **Authority**: Citations, credentials, dates, sources
- **Completeness**: Query coverage, topic depth, related questions

Provide: Overall score (X/10) + 2-3 sentence summary

### 2. Identify Strengths

List 3-5 elements already optimized well. For each:
- What's working
- Why it works for AEO
- Impact on AI citations

### 3. Priority Fixes

Provide exactly 5 fixes, ranked by impact.

**Format each as:**
```
[Number]. [Clear Action Title]
- Current issue: [What's wrong specifically]
- Why it matters: [Direct impact on AI citations]
- How to fix: [Specific actionable step]
```

### 4. Content Gaps

Identify 3-5 missing queries to address.

**Format each as:**
```
"[Question users ask]"
- Why add this: [Search relevance / user need]
- Where to add: [Specific section recommendation]
```

### 5. Structural Recommendations

Provide reorganized outline that improves AI parsing:

```
Recommended Structure:

1. [Section Name] - [Purpose/Goal]
   - Key Point A
   - Key Point B
   
2. [Section Name] - [Purpose/Goal]
   - Subsection 1
   - Subsection 2
   
3. FAQ Section
   Q: [Common question]
   A: [Direct answer]
```

Explain: Why this structure works better for AI models

### 6. Sample Optimization

Show before/after for one key section:

**Original:**
```
[Current text - copy exact section]
```

**Optimized:**
```
[Improved version with changes applied]
```

**Changes Made:**
- ✅ [Specific improvement 1]
- ✅ [Specific improvement 2]
- ✅ [Specific improvement 3]

### 7. Quick Wins

List 3-5 easy changes with immediate impact:
- [ ] [Specific action that takes <5 minutes]
- [ ] [Specific action with clear benefit]

### 8. Expected Impact

Quantify predicted improvements:
- **AI Citation Potential**: [Current score]/10 → [Predicted score]/10
- **Query Coverage**: Currently answers [X] queries → Will answer [Y] queries
- **Authority Signals**: [Current score]/10 → [Predicted score]/10

## Output Template

Use this exact format for consistency:

```markdown
# 🎯 AEO Score: X/10

[2-3 sentence overall assessment of optimization level]

```

## Core AEO Principles

### Answer First Pattern
Place direct answer in first 100 words. AI models heavily weight early content when extracting answers.

**Example:**
✅ "X costs $50-200 depending on size. Basic models start at $50..."
❌ "There are many factors to consider when pricing X. Let's explore..."

### Question Headings
Use H2/H3 as questions people actually ask:

**Examples:**
- ✅ "How much does X cost?"
- ✅ "What's the difference between X and Y?"
- ❌ "Pricing Information"
- ❌ "Comparison Details"

### Entity-Based Language
Use specific names, brands, and concepts:

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Mailchimp integrates with Shopify to sync customer data"
- ❌ "The tool works with e-commerce platforms"
- ✅ "According to Gartner's 2024 report"
- ❌ "According to industry research"

### Citation Signals
Include these authority markers:
- Author name and credentials
- Publication date
- Last updated date
- Source links for claims
- Specific data with attribution

### Conversational Patterns
Write how people speak, not how algorithms think:

**Examples:**
- ✅ "You can expect to pay $50-200 for installation"
- ❌ "Installation costs vary by configuration parameters"
- ✅ "This works best if you have 10+ employees"
- ❌ "Optimal for mid-sized organizational structures"

## Content Type Guidelines

### Product Pages
**Structure:** Quick overview → What is it → Features → Pricing → Who it's for → Comparison → FAQ

**Key elements:**
- Direct answer in first paragraph
- Feature benefits (not just features)
- Concrete pricing with tiers
- Use case scenarios
- Head-to-head comparison table
- 5-10 FAQ questions

### How-To Guides
**Structure:** Quick answer → Prerequisites → Step-by-step → Troubleshooting → Related guides

**Key elements:**
- TL;DR answer upfront
- Time/difficulty estimate
- Numbered steps with expected outcomes
- Common problems + solutions
- Links to related content

### Comparison Articles
**Structure:** Quick verdict → At-a-glance table → Detailed comparison → Use cases → Recommendation → FAQ

**Key elements:**
- Winner declared immediately
- Comparison table in first 200 words
- Feature-by-feature analysis
- Real-world use case scenarios
- Clear final recommendation

### FAQ Pages
**Structure:** Grouped questions (Getting Started → Features → Troubleshooting → Pricing)

**Key elements:**
- Questions as users ask them
- Direct 2-3 sentence answers
- No question left vague
- Links to detailed guides
- Update date visible

**For detailed templates:** See [content-templates.md](references/content-templates.md)
