## Workflow Guide

### Writing Compelling Bullets

**When to use:** Product features, benefit lists, course modules, email previews

1. Identify your core benefits/features
2. Check `references/bullet-points.md` for the 19 formulas
3. Pick 3-5 different formulas (avoid repetition)
4. Transform features into emotional triggers
5. Test: Does each bullet create curiosity AND desire?

**Quick Formula Selector:**
- **Build Authority** → #3 Giveaway, #9 Single Most
- **Create Fear** → #2 Two-Step, #15 What Never  
- **Spark Curiosity** → #1 Wrong!, #12 Sneaky, #18 Secrets Of
- **Direct Benefits** → #5 Naked Benefit, #10 How-To

### Crafting Headlines & Hooks

**When to use:** Email subjects, ad headlines, section headers, landing pages

1. Determine market sophistication level (1-5)
2. Identify audience awareness level
3. Review `references/headlines-hooks.md` for matching templates
4. Combine template with your unique mechanism
5. Add specificity (numbers, timeframes, emotional triggers)

**Sophistication Quick Guide:**
- **Level 1-2:** Simple bold claims work
- **Level 3-4:** Need mechanism + proof
- **Level 5:** Require indirect story approach

### Writing Stories That Sell

**When to use:** Email campaigns, sales page leads, case studies, testimonials

1. Visit reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts
2. Sort by Top (Week/Month/Year)
3. Find prompt matching your message
4. Read top comments for structure ideas
5. Follow framework in `references/storytelling.md`
6. Bridge story to reader's situation

**Story Template Selector:**
- **Build Trust** → Mentor Story, Observation Story
- **Show Transformation** → Failure-to-Success, Discovery
- **Create Urgency** → Reluctant Hero

### The 5-Part Edit

**When to use:** After writing any copy (never during writing!)

Follow this exact sequence:

1. **Elements Check** (Part 1)
   - Run through checklist in `references/editing-framework.md`
   - Add missing components

2. **Clarity Pass** (Part 2)
   - Hunt: Pronouns, big words, repetitions, qualifiers, adverbs
   - Replace with simple, specific language

3. **Flow Enhancement** (Part 3)
   - Add curiosity seeds
   - Insert open loops before boring sections
   - Smooth transitions between paragraphs

4. **Headline Story** (Part 4)
   - Read only headlines top to bottom
   - Ensure they tell complete story alone

5. **Read Aloud** (Part 5)
   - Mark every stumble point
   - Rewrite until smooth

| Warm audience | Problem-agitation | "Sick of X?" |
| Retargeting | Mechanism | "The 3-step system..." |

## Common Patterns

### The Awareness Ladder

Match your tactical execution to awareness:

**Unaware** → Story-based hooks + emotional bullets
**Problem-aware** → Agitation hooks + fear bullets  
**Solution-aware** → Mechanism hooks + benefit bullets
**Product-aware** → Comparison hooks + proof bullets
**Most-aware** → Offer hooks + urgency bullets

### The Edit Priority Matrix

Limited time? Focus here:

**5 minutes:** Headlines + CTAs only
**15 minutes:** + Clarity hunt + transitions
**30 minutes:** + Full flow + read aloud
**60 minutes:** Complete 5-part system

## Implementation Examples

### Bullet Transformation

**Before (boring):**
"Learn email marketing"

**After (Formula #7 - If/Then):**
"If you can write a text message, you can build a $10k/month email list"

### Hook Evolution

**Level 1:** "Lose weight fast"
**Level 3:** "New enzyme melts fat"
**Level 5:** "I couldn't pick up my grandchild..."

### Story Opening

**Standard:** "Let me tell you about marketing"
**Reddit-method:** "The consultant sat across from me, sliding a check for $100,000..."

## Troubleshooting

### "My bullets aren't converting"
- Mix formulas (using same one repeatedly kills impact)
- Add specificity (vague = death)
- Check emotional triggers

### "Headlines feel flat"
- Wrong sophistication level for market
- Missing mechanism/uniqueness
- Too generic (could apply to any product)

### "Stories aren't engaging"
- No open loops maintaining curiosity
- Missing emotional moments
- Weak bridge to reader's situation

### "Copy feels choppy"
- Run Part 3 (Flow) of editing framework
- Add transitions between thoughts
- Check paragraph endings for forward momentum
