## Core Principles

**Critical:** Hooks are part of the sales message, not standalone templates. They must match your market's awareness and sophistication levels.

### When Templates Fail

The classic "How to X without Y" template would fail in saturated markets like weight loss because prospects have seen these claims hundreds of times. Your hook must fit:
- Market sophistication level
- Audience awareness level
- Your big idea/angle/mechanism

### Hook Selection Process

1. Understand your market's awareness level
2. Determine sophistication level
3. Develop your big idea/mechanism
4. THEN select a hook that fits
