# The 5-Part Editing Framework

## Core Philosophy

**Writing is creative. Editing is mechanical.**

They use different parts of the brain - never edit while writing or you'll kill creativity. Write first, edit second.

## Part 1: Editing for Elements

Ensure all essential sales page elements are present. This is a technical checklist - mark each item as present or add if missing.

### Essential Elements Checklist

**Core Components:**
- [ ] Headline
- [ ] Lead
- [ ] Promise
- [ ] Proof
- [ ] Objection handling
- [ ] Self-introduction
- [ ] Guarantee
- [ ] Offer
- [ ] Button/CTA
- [ ] FAQ
- [ ] Scarcity
- [ ] Urgency
- [ ] Summary of what you're getting

**Footer Requirements:**
- [ ] Terms and conditions
- [ ] Refund policy  
- [ ] Privacy policy

**Conditional Elements** (include if applicable):
- [ ] Mechanism
- [ ] PR/Media mentions
- [ ] Bonuses
- [ ] Transformation story

## Part 2: Editing for Clarity

Make sure everything is CLEAR and understandable.

### Clarity Checklist

**Apply these rules:**
- [ ] Rule of One maintained (one person, one problem, one solution)
- [ ] No big words or complex vocabulary
- [ ] No technical jargon (or explained if necessary)
- [ ] All sentences under 20 words when possible
- [ ] Hemingway score under 6th grade

### The Hunt System

#### Pronoun Hunt
**Search for:** he, she, it, them, they

**Problem:**
"Mark met Michael. He told him..."
(Who told whom?)

**Solution:**
Replace with specific names/nouns for clarity

#### Big Word Hunt
**Action:** Find and replace complex vocabulary

Use thesaurus.com for simpler alternatives

Examples to replace:
- Utilize → Use
- Purchase → Buy
- Assistance → Help
- Commence → Start

#### Repeat Word Hunt
**Problem:** Using same word twice in close proximity

**Wrong:** "Mark ate dinner. He loved what he ate."
**Right:** "Mark ate dinner. He enjoyed his eggs."

#### Qualifier Hunt
**Remove these weakeners:**
- Some
- Mostly
- Could
- Partially
- May
- Possibly
- Perhaps
- Might

**Weak:** "I got some of the best students"
**Strong:** "I got the best students"

#### Adverb Hunt
**Search for:** words ending in "ly"

Replace or remove:
- Extremely
- Nicely
- Amazingly
- Quickly
- Really
- Very

## Part 3: Editing for Flow

Ensure copy has momentum and logical progression.

### Flow Techniques

#### Seeds of Curiosity
Insert phrases that maintain reading momentum:
- "But there's more..."
- "It got worse..."
- "Here's why..."
- "Let me explain..."
- "What happened next..."

#### Open Loops
Start thought → Insert important info → Complete thought

Use before boring sections (like self-introduction) to maintain interest

#### Transitions
Connect sentences and paragraphs:
- And
- But
- Plus
- So
- Because
- Which means
- In fact
- Actually

#### Never Close a Thought
Always lead to the next idea. Every paragraph should make the reader want to read the next one.

### Making It Impossible to Stop Reading

1. **Every headline creates curiosity**
2. **Every paragraph ends with forward momentum**
3. **Every section bridges to the next**
4. **Questions get answered... eventually**

## Part 4: Editing Headlines Only

Read ONLY headlines from top to bottom. They should tell a complete story without body copy.

### Headline Story Test

A scanner should understand:
- The problem
- The solution  
- The benefits
- The offer
- How to buy

Without reading anything else.

### Headline Criteria

Each headline should:
- Create curiosity OR state benefit
- Connect to previous headline
- Lead to next headline
- Be specific, not vague
- Include emotional trigger when possible

## Part 5: Final Edit - The Read Aloud Test

Read entire copy OUT LOUD.

### Rules for Read Aloud

1. **Mark every stumble point** - Even in non-native language
2. **Note breathing issues** - Sentences too long
3. **Listen for rhythm** - Monotonous = boring
4. **Check emotional peaks** - Do they hit right?
5. **Time the read** - Note where attention might wander

### After Marking Issues

For each marked spot:
1. Identify why you stumbled
2. Diagnose the problem:
   - Too complex?
   - Poor word choice?
   - Logical gap?
   - Rhythm issue?
3. Rewrite until smooth

## Additional Editing Principles

### The "I" to "You" Formula

Talk about yourself in negative → Switch to reader's benefit in positive

**Example:**
"No matter how much time I spent writing, my copy never seemed to work until... I discovered this formula YOU can now use to write world-class copy."

### The "SO WHAT?" Test

Read each line from skeptical CEO perspective. Ask "SO WHAT?!" 

If the answer isn't compelling - remove or rewrite.

### Eliminate Yes-Yes Sentences

Sentences that mean nothing and give nothing:
- "We care about you"
- "Quality is our priority"
- "We're the best"

These are death to conversions.

### Use Their Language

Never use your vocabulary - use theirs:
- Research how they describe their problem
- Note exact phrases they use
- Mirror their complexity level
- Include their insider terms (explained)

### Technical Jargon Strategy

**When you must use jargon:**

"Vocal registers (the different types of voice from your head, chest, and stomach)"

Use the term for those who know it, then explain for those who don't.

## Editing Sequence

**Never edit everything at once.** Follow this sequence:

1. **First Pass:** Elements checklist
2. **Second Pass:** Clarity and hunts
3. **Third Pass:** Flow and momentum
4. **Fourth Pass:** Headlines only
5. **Final Pass:** Read aloud

## Common Editing Mistakes

1. **Over-editing:** Removing personality
2. **Under-editing:** Leaving confusion
3. **Wrong sequence:** Editing while writing
4. **Perfectionism:** Never shipping
5. **Ignoring structure:** Focusing only on words

## The Editing Mindset

- You're a surgeon, not an artist
- Every cut should improve clarity
- If unsure, test both versions
- Reader experience trumps writer preference
- Done is better than perfect
