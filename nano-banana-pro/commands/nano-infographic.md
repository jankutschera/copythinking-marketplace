## Content Types

### 1. Whiteboard/Glass Board Presentation
For explaining concepts, strategies, or data visually.
```
Generate an ultra-realistic scene in a modern conference room (16:9). A large wall-mounted glass board is the focal point, covered in deep [blue/black] marker in natural human handwriting. [PRESENTER] stands beside the board, mid-gesture, explaining content to viewers.

Text and diagrams are clearly handwritten: bold all-caps headings, italic subheadings, smaller neat notes, arrows and icons with slight wobble and pressure variation. The ink looks convincingly real with darker edges, subtle streaks, tiny smudges.

Topic: [TOPIC WITH KEY POINTS]

Glass shows room reflections, premium office lighting, 8K quality. Use uploaded reference photo exactly for presenter's likeness.
```
