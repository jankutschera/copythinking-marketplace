## Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use Misspellings (Sparingly)
Common misspellings can capture traffic:
- "colouring" (UK) vs "coloring" (US)
- "organisation" vs "organization"

### Tip 2: Include Format Variations
- "ebook" "e-book" "e book"
- "audiobook" "audio book"

### Tip 3: Seasonal Keywords (If Relevant)
- "halloween gift" "christmas present"
- "summer read" "vacation book"

### Tip 4: Problem-Solution Pairs
- "anxiety help" "stress management"
- "weight loss journey" "fitness motivation"

### Tip 5: Combine Singular/Plural
Since Amazon treats them similarly, pick the higher-volume variant:
- "recipe" vs "recipes" (check autocomplete for which is more common)
