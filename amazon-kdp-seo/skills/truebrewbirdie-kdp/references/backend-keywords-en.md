### Golden Rules

| Rule | Explanation |
|------|-------------|
| **No quotes** | Quotes restrict to exact match only |
| **No commas needed** | Spaces work as separators |
| **Don't repeat title words** | Already indexed from title/subtitle |
| **No subjective claims** | "best", "top", "#1" are prohibited |
| **No time-sensitive terms** | "new", "2024", "latest" lose value |
| **No competitor names** | Trademark issues |
| **No irrelevant keywords** | Can get book suppressed |

❌ Using "BDSM" or "guide" in backend keywords
✅ Using synonyms and related terms not in title

### 3. Using Competitor Brand Names
❌ "better than fifty shades"
✅ "fifty shades alternative"

### 4. Irrelevant Keywords for Traffic
❌ Adding trending unrelated keywords
✅ Only relevant keywords that match content

### 5. Single-Word Keywords
❌ Box 1: "BDSM" (wastes space)
✅ Box 1: "dom sub relationship power exchange beginner"
