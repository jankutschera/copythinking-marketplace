## Category Selection Interface

### How It Works

1. **Main Category** → Select from dropdown (e.g., "Gesundheit, Fitness & Diät")
2. **Subcategory** → Select from second dropdown
3. **Placement** → Check specific subcategories in the placement box

### Important: Some Paths Lead to Different Destinations

The same "end category" might appear through different paths:
- Path A: Fiction → Romance → Contemporary
- Path B: Literature → Women's Fiction → Romance

**Both might show "Romance" but rank in different browse nodes!**

## The 3-Category Strategy

### Optimal Distribution

```
Category 1: BROAD (Traffic & Credibility)
├── High competition
├── High traffic
├── Harder to rank
└── Builds authority

Category 2: MEDIUM (Balance)
├── Moderate competition
├── Good traffic
├── Achievable ranking
└── Sweet spot for visibility

Category 3: NICHE (Bestseller Badge)
├── Low competition
├── Lower traffic
├── Easy to rank
└── Orange bestseller badge achievable
```

### Real Example: BDSM Guide

| Category | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **1. Broad** | Health > Sex-Ratgeber | High traffic, authority |
| **2. Medium** | Health > Partnerschaft > Allgemeines | Balanced |
| **3. Niche** | Sachbücher > Partnerschaft > Beziehungen | Bestseller potential |

### Real Example: Coloring Book

| Category | Path | Purpose |
|----------|------|---------|
| **1. Broad** | Arts & Crafts > Coloring Books | Main traffic source |
| **2. Medium** | Self-Help > Stress Management | Alt audience |
| **3. Niche** | Crafts > Sugar Skull / Day of Dead | Niche ranking |

## Common Category Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Wrong Category Type

**Problem:** Selecting Fiction categories for Non-Fiction books (or vice versa)

**Example from real case:**
```
WRONG: Belletristik > Dramatik > Schwul & Lesbisch
       (This is for LGBTQ+ drama/fiction, not guides)

RIGHT: Gesundheit > Sex-Ratgeber
       (This is for sex education/guides)
```

**Impact:** Wrong audience, poor conversion, potential removal

### ❌ Mistake 2: Ghost Categories

**Problem:** Some categories don't award bestseller badges

**How to check:**
1. Find current #1 in that category
2. If they have orange "#1 Bestseller" badge → Valid
3. If no badge visible → Ghost category, avoid

### ❌ Mistake 3: Irrelevant Niche Categories

**Problem:** Choosing low-competition categories that don't match content

**Example:**
```
WRONG: Book about cooking → Category: "Pet Care" (low competition)
RIGHT: Book about cooking → Category: "Quick & Easy Cooking"
```

**Impact:** Angry readers, bad reviews, potential policy violation

### ❌ Mistake 4: All 3 Categories Too Similar

**Problem:** Wasting category slots on overlapping audiences

**Example:**
```
WRONG:
1. Romance > Contemporary
2. Romance > New Adult
3. Romance > Women's Fiction
(All essentially same audience)

RIGHT:
1. Romance > Contemporary (main)
2. Fiction > Coming of Age (different browse)
3. Literature > Women's Fiction (different entry point)
```

| **Review count of #1** | Check listing | < 500 achievable |
| **Bestseller badge** | Is it visible? | Must be YES |
| **Relevance** | Does your book fit? | Must be YES |

### Step 3: Test Categories

Categories can be changed! Test strategy:

1. **Week 1-2:** Start with your 3 best guesses
2. **Monitor:** Track BSR changes daily
3. **Week 3-4:** Swap underperforming category

### Tip 2: Season-Aware Categories
Some categories spike seasonally:
- Gift books → Q4
