## Category Strategy: The 3-Tier Approach

### Category 1: Broad (Traffic)
- High traffic category
- More competition
- Establishes credibility
- Example: "Self-Help" or "Health & Fitness"

### Category 2: Medium (Balance)
- Moderate traffic and competition
- More targeted audience
- Good visibility
- Example: "Relationships & Sexuality"

### Category 3: Niche (Bestseller Potential)
- Lower competition
- Realistic Top 20 ranking
- Bestseller badge opportunity
- Example: "Sex-Ratgeber" (Sex Guides)

## Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Irrelevant Categories
❌ Placing a BDSM guide in "LGBTQ+ Drama & Theater"
✅ Placing it in "Sex-Ratgeber" and "Partnerschaft & Beziehungen"

**Why it matters:** Wrong categories mean wrong audience = no sales

### Mistake 2: Fiction vs. Non-Fiction Mix
❌ Guide book in "Belletristik" (Fiction) categories
✅ Guide book in "Sachbücher" (Non-Fiction) or "Lebensführung" (Self-Help)

**Why it matters:** Fiction categories are for novels/stories, not how-to books

### Mistake 3: Only Choosing Tiny Niches
❌ Three ultra-specific categories with no traffic
✅ Mix of broad (traffic) and niche (ranking potential)

### Mistake 4: Ghost Categories
Some categories don't award bestseller badges!
- Check if category shows bestseller rankings
- Test by viewing category on Amazon

## How to Verify Category Choice

### Before Publishing:
1. Go to Amazon.de/com
2. Navigate to your target category
3. Check the #1 bestseller's ranking number
4. Lower number = more competitive
5. Higher number = easier to rank

### Category Competitiveness Guide:
| #1 Book BSR | Competitiveness | Sales Needed |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Under 5,000 | Very High | 50+ daily |
| 5,000-20,000 | High | 20-50 daily |
| 20,000-50,000 | Medium | 10-20 daily |
| 50,000-100,000 | Low | 5-10 daily |
| Over 100,000 | Very Low | 1-5 daily |

## Real Example: BDSM Guide Fix

### Before (Wrong):
1. Elternschaft & Beziehungen → Allgemeine... ⚠️
2. Lebensführung → Allgemeine Selbsthilfe ⚠️
3. Belletristik → Dramatik → **Schwul & Lesbisch** ❌

**Problems:**
- Category 3 is Fiction (Dramatik = Drama/Theater)
- Category 3 implies LGBTQ+ focus that isn't the book's main angle
- Book appears in wrong browse sections

### After (Correct):
1. Gesundheit, Fitness & Diät → **Sex-Ratgeber** ✅
2. Gesundheit → Partnerschaft & Beziehungen → Allgemeines ✅
3. Sachbücher → Partnerschaft & Beziehungen → Beziehungen ✅

**Why this works:**
- All three are non-fiction/guide categories
- Sex-Ratgeber is the most relevant niche
- Partnerschaft & Beziehungen captures relationship-focused readers
